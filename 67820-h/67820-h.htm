<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>It was, I suppose, during the closing months of the First
World War that an urbane and witty gentleman, writing in
the Confederate city of Richmond, set down these words in
the course of one of his interminable, and witty and urbane,
monologues: “I wonder if you are familiar with that uncanny
genius whom the London directory prosaically lists as
Arthur Machen?”</p>

<p>Since there was no reply, as indeed none was expected,
the amiable Charteris chatted on about Arthur Machen and,
oddly enough, Robert W. Chambers, for some moments, and
then he concluded with this statement.... “But here in a
secluded library is no place to speak of the thirty years’ neglect
that has been accorded Mr. Arthur Machen; it is the
sort of crime that ought to be discussed in the Biblical manner,
from the house-top....”</p>

<p>That thirty years’ neglect has almost doubled—and indeed
one might say with perfect truth that Arthur Machen
has suffered a lifetime of neglect, <i>and</i>, in perfect truth, it
must be added that the loss has been the world’s which so
blindly accorded neglect to the uncanny genius of Arthur
Machen.</p>

<p>This is the sort of crime, as Mr. James Branch Cabell
suggested back in 1918, that ought to be discussed in the
Biblical manner—and it is my intention to do so.</p>

<p>At this point there will be voices raised in protest ...
dim voices trained to the librarian’s whisper, voices that echo
in the vaults of university libraries and in the reading rooms
of Memorial Collections. There will be other voices—the
amiable, all-inclusive voice of the anthologist and the rasping
roar of the reprint editor. There will be the excited exclamations
of the cultists and the happy burblings of the bibliographers
as they pounce upon another Machen item. And
of course we may expect to hear the calm and cultured tones
of the collectors, the excavators and the discoverers, who have
pointed with smug satisfaction to their rows of faded bindings
and their “obscure little pamphlets.” As for the horror
boys, happy with their harpies and hieroglyphs and wild hallucinations,
they will probably croak and sibilate in unholy
glee and rush down to start their presses—reprinting madly
all they can find of the magical tales of that wonderful
Welshman, Arthur Machen.</p>

<p>It will appear that I anticipate a renewed interest in the
works of Arthur Machen. I do. It may even become apparent
that I expect the publication of this book to work the miracle—to
right the wrong of sixty years of neglect. I do. Nor
is this to be attributed to egotism, nor to a vast respect for my
powers of persuasion. A number of literary men, of small
stature and great, have written well and passionately of Arthur
Machen, only to have their effusions produce a magnificent
calm. It is simply that there are signs and portents (of
which more anon) that the time is now. And then of course
there is always the bare hope that my admiration for Arthur
Machen and my enthusiasm for his work may be contagious
enough to result in another Arthurian revival. That would be
an event to rival a genuine miracle at Glastonbury itself.</p>

<p>I spoke of the voices that will be raised in praise and
recognition of Arthur Machen. It may occur to some that
there was bitterness in what I said, and in the way I spoke
of collectors and cultists, and of bibliographers and bibliophiles,
and of anthologists and of the zealots of the pulp
press. I daresay it is true that I am inclined to be bitter over
the neglect accorded Arthur Machen. Of course the blame
for that neglect cannot be fixed or fastened—but it must
rest somewhere between the publishers of limited editions
and the reprinters of almost unlimited editions, between the
alpha and the omega, and the buying and reading public.
That covers a lot of territory. One cannot indict the publishing
world from top, literally, to bottom, literally. One cannot
indict, to paraphrase a much quoted statement of Edmund
Burke’s, an entire reading public. One can, to make a
concrete proposal, attempt to do something about it.</p>

<p>The interest shown in the prospectus announcing this
book has been gratifying, but it does not, to my mind at
least, dismiss the charge of neglect. It merely indicates that
there are others who bear witness to the crime and who
wish to see justice done.</p>

<p>The book has been announced as a critical survey—and
it will be that. Many of the stories, written in that decade of
the delicate decadents, will be re-examined and re-evaluated.
Mr. Machen will sometimes be spoken of as a “Gothick
novelist”—a thing he has said he is not. The stories of the
“Great War,” as he called it, are seen in a new perspective,
as anyone must know who has re-read them, especially <i>The
Terror</i>, in the past few years.</p>

<p>Many of Machen’s articles and essays, and such works
as <i>Hieroglyphics</i> and <i>Doctor Stiggins</i>, offer food for thought
to those who may think, for example, that Mr. James Farrell
has settled literary criteria, once and for all, in his book, of
a few years ago, <i>The League of Frightened Philistines</i>.</p>

<p>This book is, then, the result of some twenty years preparation;
at least half of them spent in planning to “do something
about it.” The book has grown slowly, with many
interruptions before, during and since the war. The opening
chapter or Prologue, called “Conversation Piece,” was written
a dozen or so years ago. It was scheduled for publication
in one of the ephemeral magazines of the day. This
particular one proved to be more ephemeral than most ... to
paraphrase a rather famous line, “it sank from sight before
it was set.” However, the piece is here presented as it was
written some twelve years back. I believe now, as I did then,
that there was need for a book about Arthur Machen. I hope
this book will fill that need.</p>

<p>At least one chapter, the ninth, may seem to some a
philippic, a potpourri of purely personal preferences and
prejudices, having little to do with Arthur Machen and his
works. Needless to say, I believe it extremely relevant.</p>

<span class="smaller">CONVERSATION PIECE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“And what,” asked the younger man, “are they?” He
pointed to a long row of books plainly bound in yellow with
faded blue and almost indecipherable titles. The Host felt
a warmer glow than the brandy alone could have produced.
“They are,” he said reverently, “my Machens.”</p>

<p>“Your whats?” asked the younger man absently. He
had caught sight of a promising looking volume, enticingly
entitled <i>Aphrodite</i>, on a lower shelf. The Host intercepted
the glance, recognized the symptoms of failing interest and,
with skill born of experience, drew his chair before the
<i>Aphrodite</i> and pulled out a lapfull of the yellow books.</p>

<p>The younger man, not too obviously disappointed,
concentrated on his small globular glass of <i>Asbach Uralt</i>.
“Who,” he asked in tones that matched his look, “is
Machen?”</p>

<p>“Arthur Machen,” began the Host in a voice that
matched <i>his</i> look, “he is the ... he’s, well ... look!” He
gestured to the shelves. “Fifteen books, and there are more,
and you’ve never even heard of him. Fifteen of the most
wonderful books in the English language, and you ask who
he is!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the young man with pardonable irritation,
“just who is he?”</p>

<p>The Host settled back in his chair, fighting hard for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
composure and coherence. “Arthur Machen,” he began
again, and with every evidence of a strong determination
to speak calmly, “is the man who has written more fine
things than any dozen living authors you may care to mention.
That may strike you as a rather broad and rash statement,
but I am in a mood to shoot the works. And there
are others, Highly Connected and Well Thought Of Persons,
who have indicated much the same opinion. Arthur
Machen has been appreciated by some of our best known
composers of ‘literary appreciations.’ Unfortunately, this sort
of praising is often akin to, and almost as effective as, burying.
To the popular mind, a writer who has been appreciated
by a duly accredited appreciator is a pet of the pedants, a
delight of the dilettantes and nothing more. And, indeed, the
titles found on some of the books containing these little
essays in literary appreciation are often suggestive of archeological
exploration rather than of due honor to a living author.
I have in mind, specifically, two books whose titles
seem to connote research into a particularly distant past.
<i>Buried Caesars</i> and <i>Excavations</i>, those two books you see
there; they would tell you in a much more literary style, and
with considerable technical flourish, just who and what Arthur
Machen was and is. But I am not minded to ask you to
read them at present.</p>

<p>“I think,” resumed the Host generously gesturing toward
the decanter and his friend’s glass, “that the time has
come for a new and revised estimate of Arthur Machen.
Would that I had the time, talent and/or the temerity to
undertake the task! Let us, meanwhile, acknowledge but
pass by these appreciators of Machen, at least for the moment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
He has attracted the attention and been subject to
the discussion of Vincent Starrett, Carl Van Vechten, James
Branch Cabell and others. He has even attracted the notice
of such literary titans as Tiffany Thayer and Burton Rascoe.
He has been crowned by that arbiter elegantiarum of American
manners, morals and mentality, Walter Winchell, who
once described Arthur Machen as ‘tops among the literati.’
This last, I fear, is not a critical estimate per se, but an indication
of a vogue in certain quarters.</p>

<p>“Despite the fact that Mr. Machen has been ‘discovered’
by at least two of our most indefatigable bolster-uppers of
literary reputations and revealers-of-lights-under-baskets; despite
his having been exhumed and placed on exhibition
upon a platform built for two, Machen remains yet to be
properly appreciated and honored by a wider public. Perhaps
he never will be, and perhaps it is best so. Machen once
wrote that if a great book is really popular it is sure to owe
its popularity to entirely wrong reasons. And I, for one,
tremble to think of what Hollywood might do to Machen.”
The Host paused briefly for replenishment.</p>

<p>“Far too often these appreciations have degenerated
into what I have in my more bitter moments mentally called
<i>Match-Machen</i>. An execrable pun, I grant you, but concerning
a matter that is, to my mind, as offensive. I refer to the
practice of certain appreciators who, in the execution of their
self-appointed duties find it, for some reason or other, necessary
to devise improbable genealogies to demonstrate their
own wide literary knowledge and their conception of the
subject of their labors. We find, for example, <i>Mr. X</i> in the
act of appreciating a book by <i>Mr. Y</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>“How does he go about it? Why, he merely tells you
that <i>Mr. Y</i> is the literary son of <i>A</i> out of <i>B</i>, whose maternal
grandmother was <i>C</i>, and whose second-cousin is <i>D</i>. Another
trick is to pretend that <i>Mr. Y’s</i> work is a play ... with
music by <i>R</i>, scenery by <i>S</i>, costumes by <i>T</i> and lyrics by <i>W</i>. In
short, you come away without the slightest notion about
<i>Mr. Y</i>. But you have learned that <i>Mr. X</i> knows a great deal,
apparently, about the doings of <i>Messrs. A, B, C, D, R, S, T
and W</i>. Do you follow me?”</p>

<p>“But slightly,” confessed the younger man with that
candor born of brandy.</p>

<p>“I will try to make myself clear,” said the Host selecting
a volume from the shelves.</p>

<p>“Here we have an essay about a man called, let us say
Blank. The author of this little essay will tell you that a
passage of Blank’s prose suggests one of the more poignant
episodes out of de Maupassant, set to music by Tchaikowski
against a background of Gaugain’s Tahitian belles. Have
you any idea what Blank’s prose is like?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the young man morosely.</p>

<p>“Good! Listen then to this. It is Vincent Starrett on
Machen: ‘Joris Karl Huysmans, in a thoroughly good translation,
perhaps remotely suggests Machen, both are debtors
to Baudelaire.’ Now, does that tell you anything about Machen?”</p>

<p>“No, it does not!” said the young man. “But then,
neither have you!”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” nodded the Host affably. “I am often carried
away. But we have ably demonstrated my contention.”
The younger man looked decidedly restless. “Um!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>“Know then,” said the Host relishing the sound of his
voice, “that Arthur Machen, born in 1863, the son of a
Welsh clergyman, first swam into the public ken early in the
last decade of the last century—a fact which the public largely
failed to appreciate until some years later. His earlier
works were translations of the <i>Heptameron</i>, the <i>Memoirs of
Casanova</i>, and several other large and, I should think, rather
dull old works. But the most important were two remarkably
unique books called <i>The Anatomy of Tobacco</i> and <i>The
Chronicle of Clemendy</i>.</p>

<p>“Most of Machen’s best work was written before 1901—and
in that year he temporarily deserted literature for the
stage. Machen’s most productive period then, from 1890 to
1901, affords a curious and striking contrast with what was
assumed to be the important literature and the important
literary group of the time. The 1890’s in England were celebrated,
although few people grow festive about it now, for
the Yellow Book Boys, that delightful coterie of delicate
decadents who glorified the carnation and the pansy. But
after the maddest music had died away, and the reddest wine
had been drunk, Cynara and Dorian fluttered to the shelves
and Oscar and Hubert and Adelbert retired into a certain
pastel-shaded obscurity from which they emerge from time
to time as a new volume of memoirs is published. The period
still commands a certain amount of academic attention—and
yet the best books of that period were written not by
these ‘Men of the Nineties,’ but by Arthur Machen. A chap
named Muddiman, whose book you see there, wrote his history
of these fellows and mentions Machen but briefly:
‘Arthur Machen, in those days, belonged to the short story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
writers with Hubert Crackanthorpe, who was the great
imaginative prose writer of the group.’ Alas, poor Hubert!
Who knows him now! Holbrook Jackson and Richard Le
Gallienne ignore Machen completely. And perhaps rightly
so. Machen was not of the group, nor of the period. But here
I wish to digress briefly....</p>

<p>“These delicate contemporaries of Machen derived from
the French Symbolistes, who derived from Mallarme and
Baudelaire, both of whom were admittedly influenced by
Poe. It has been said that Machen was also influenced by Poe.
The difference, if you will credit me, is that Poe’s influence,
in as far as it exists, came to Machen direct. When it came
to the others of the group it had been filtered through Gallic
gravel and Symbolistic sand.</p>

<p>“So much for Machen’s literary history. No one could
possibly tell it better than he has in <i>Things Near and Far</i>
and <i>Far Off Things</i>—his two autobiographical collections.
Nor is any literary history as simply told. It is not one of your
tremendous collections of anecdotes concerning ‘literary figures
of the day.’ It is the story of a lonely man who wanted,
more than anything else, to write. And then—you must read
Machen. All of him. I know of no other writer whose entire
output can be so heartily recommended.</p>

<p>“You will realize, as you read, that when people use
such names as Poe, Stevenson, Blackwood, and Henry James,
they are but vaguely gesturing in the general direction of
Machen’s own weird landscape. It is a land as strange as the
misty mid-region of Weir where lies the dank tarn of Auber,
the measureless caverns where runs the sacred river Alph.
But it is like none of these. The young man of Gwent has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
created his own landscape, a strange country spread out
under a sky that glows as if great furnace doors had been
opened, bordered by tall grey mountains, traversed by streams
that coil their esses through silent woods. It is my fancy to
think I have a picture of that country, painted by another
genius. You see that Van Gogh hanging there?” The Host
indicated a large framed print of writhing cypresses under
a swirling sky. “On quiet November nights I sit here and
look into it, half expecting to see young Meyrick or Lucian
Taylor come down the hillside.</p>

<p>“It is curious to go over some of these former estimates
of Arthur Machen. One first reads them through in
a fine enthusiasm at finding someone else who has read
Machen and found him good. But even those who praise
him the most, fail to express, or even to hint at the
‘quiddity’ of Machen. They seem to find him so far beyond
their powers to praise that they often resort to picayunish
criticism. Thus we find Vincent Starrett mildly complaining
about an absence of cloud descriptions in Machen. Or about
a lack of humor. True, you’ll find no Maxfield Parrish sky
castles, no James Gould Fletcher touches, no rotogravure
alto-cirrus formations. But if ever a man could imply clouds
without using the very word, Machen can. And although
Machen has not yet introduced a pair of jolly grave-diggers
to coax us back into our seats or cajole us into combing
back our bristling hair, you will find he has humor.</p>

<p>“There does exist, however, a problem in classifying
Machen—it seems to exist only a necessary evil. Essentially,
I suppose, Machen is what might be called a Gothic novelist.
He has been linked so often with the recognized practitioners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of the Gothic style and tradition. You’ll find no ivy-covered
ruins, no deserted abbeys, no ravens, no baying mastiffs, not
even a sinister monk—and we must rule out those jolly tosspots,
the monks of Abergavenny. I daresay Machen would
prefer to be known as a Silurist. His ruins are those of an
older time, older even than the ruins of the golden city of the
Roman legions.</p>

<p>“Vincent Starrett calls Machen the Novelist of Ecstasy
and Sin—making him sound rather like a Messalinaen Lady
Novelist. Mr. Van Vechten too, at least in his decadent
novel <i>Peter Whiffle</i>, seizes upon Mr. Machen from much the
same viewpoint, and makes Machen an asset in the character
of his precious Peter. And all too frequently, in discussing
Machen, the spirit of Baudelaire raises its ugly head.
Novelist of Sin, forsooth! ‘Evil, be thou my good!’ What
rot! And there are those, apparently, who would classify
some of Machen’s tales as ‘erotica.’ Baudelaire, bosh! As
well point out the resemblance between a lane in Gwent and
a lupanar in Paris! No—Machen is neither a Gothic novelist
nor a writer of delectable indelicacies. Machen’s tag must be
sought for in hieroglyphics of his own devising.</p>

<p>“The ‘quiddity’ of Machen, the one quality that pervades
all his work, is that of ‘ecstasy.’ It is not the ecstasy of
the lyric lady-novelist. Mr. Starrett seems to think it is a
technical device, since he finds it is ‘due in no small degree
to his beautiful English style.’ Mr. Machen’s own idea of
this quality is that it is ‘a removal from the common life.’
And that brings me to <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, a book that should be
a text-book in all our Universities. But perhaps not—no,
surely not. Because in this book of Machen’s you will find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
set forth, once and for all, the difference between reading
matter and fine literature. And such a book cannot fail to
make enemies, nor to create false ideas even among its
friends. Mr. Starrett says: ‘It is Arthur Machen’s theory of
literature and life, brilliantly exposited by that cyclical mode
of discoursing that was affected by Coleridge. In it he suggests
the admirable doctrine of James Branch Cabell that
fine literature must be, in effect, an allegory and not the careful
history of particular persons.’ Mr. Cabell, who is, according
to Mr. Starrett, Machen’s literary son, set forth
his literary credo in <i>Beyond Life</i> some seventeen years after
the publication of <i>Hieroglyphics</i>. In it, Mr. Cabell expresses
admirably, and with his famed urbanity, many of the truths
he learned at his father’s knee. One is as pleased with Cabell’s
literary progenitor as with his prose.</p>

<p>“Just one more quotation. It is my favorite quotation
to end quotations about literary credos or the mechanics of
creation. Mr. Machen, in <i>The Three Impostors</i> says: ‘... I
will give you the task of a literary man in a phrase. He has
got to do simply this—to invent a wonderful story, and to
tell it in a wonderful manner.’</p>

<p>“In his novels, <i>The Three Impostors</i>, <i>The Hill of
Dreams</i>, <i>The Secret Glory</i>, <i>The Terror</i>, <i>The Great Return</i>,
and in many of his shorter stories: <i>The Great God Pan</i>, <i>The
White People</i>, in all his creative work, Machen has shown
himself the master of his own precept. In <i>Hieroglyphics</i>
Machen noted the difference between reading matter that
related facts about a character or a group of characters, and
fine literature that symbolizes certain eternal and essential
elements in human nature by means of incidents. You will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
find, then, that these wonderful stories are not merely
startlingly original conceptions of heroes and heroines taking
part in unusual events. That many of these plots and inventions
are uncanny and fantastic does not place them in the
‘thriller’ class—having nothing more to say than the latest
detective story. It would be absurd to think of <i>The Great
God Pan</i>, for example, as merely a story about the discovery
that Pan is not dead, or that Priapic cults may still flourish.
No, it’s not so simple as that. There are other elements present,
and chiefest of these is that quality of ecstasy. There are
symbols and representations of a higher order, no cheap
mysticism, no spiritualistic clap-trap. And finally there is in
these stories an element of something that prompts belief.</p>

<p>“<i>The Great God Pan</i> is a story much more improbable,
more fantastic than <i>Frankenstein</i> or <i>The Strange Case of M.
Valdemar</i>. And it is not a mere pseudo-scientific story—it is
believable. You do not believe that? Yet Machen wrote a
story more fantastic still. A story with no possible explanation,
scientific or otherwise, in short, nothing less than miraculous
vision could have explained it. And that story was,
and still is, widely accepted as true. The tale of the <i>Bowmen</i>
at Mons, a simply written story, no flourishes, no elaborate
atmosphere; yet with that quality of ecstasy, that quiddity of
Machenism, has won belief. Quite recently, in a shop, I came
across a volume that was an anthology of Myths, mysteries,
visions and the like, and in it appeared the story of the Bowmen.
It was not Machen’s story, however, and there was no
mention whatever of Arthur Machen. It had been set down
as an authentic legend, documented and sworn to by this one
and that one who claimed to have been there. I daresay it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
will, in time, join such distinguished company as the Walls
of Jericho and Joshua’s obedient sun.</p>

<p>“Yes, you must read Machen. All of him. It has been
implied that there is a sameness about Machen’s work. But
do not imagine that you will read the same story, told and
retold. You will come to realize that there is in Machen a
definite pattern. He has said that most men, as well as writers,
are men of one idea. And most writers create tales that are
variations on one theme, that a common pattern, like the
pattern of an Eastern carpet, runs through them all. And
Machen’s pattern? You will see, when you read him, that
literature ‘began with charms, incantations, spells, songs of
mystery, chants of religious ecstasy, the Bacchic chorus, the
Rune, the Mass.’ And Machen has taken as his symbol and
pattern the devices and signs of ecstasy, of the removal from
the common life. The dance—the maze—the spiral—the
wheel—the vine, and wine, these are the outward signs of
ecstasy, the patterns of Machen.</p>

<p>“One book in particular you must read—<i>The Hill of
Dreams</i>, without a doubt one of the finest novels ever
written. From the first grand sentence a spell is laid upon you.
It has never failed to thrill me—it is like the master theme of
a symphony—it is as magical as the opening notes of the
<i>Good Friday</i> music in <i>Parsifal</i>. But there—I have fallen into
the ways of those whom I have derided. And I have kept
you quite later than I intended.”</p>

<p>The Host rose, stretched, and poured out a brace of
nightcaps. The younger man, who had listened patiently to
this lengthy monologue, gratefully accepted his brandy,
sipped rather too avidly, for listening is also a thirsty business,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and said, “Why do you suppose Arthur Machen is so
little known? I mean, he sounds marvelous—but, after all,
people can’t help it if they don’t know about him.”</p>

<p>“That,” responded the Host sadly, “is one of the Mysteries
of Mysteries. Perhaps Machen writes too ‘circumvolantly’
as Cabell says, for our critics. Or perhaps, as Van
Vechten says, ‘one only takes from a work of art what one
brings to it—and how few readers can bring to Machen the
requisite qualities.’ Perhaps our critics are more apt to be
impressed by clever young men who go about swimming
classical streams, fishing for tarpon, or fighting in the fashionable
war of the moment. The general public, unfortunately,
knows Machen, if at all, through the inclusion of several
of his stories in anthologies of mystery and horror stories.
Which is about on a par with using Shelley’s <i>Indian Serenade</i>
as a filler in a pulp confession magazine.</p>

<p>“A short time ago in London there was a dinner party
in celebration of the seventy-fifth birthday of a writer. The
guest of honor made the customary speech—but it was such
a speech as has seldom been heard from a feted author. It
was tragic, it could have been, and should have been, bitter—but
all was gently said. After toiling in the fields of literature
for over forty-two years, after having produced eighteen
volumes of rare quality, he had earned but £635. That man
was Arthur Machen.”</p>

<p>“He is still living?” asked the young man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Host gravely. “I should like to make
a pilgrimage to his home. But you must go. Take these with
you. Read them. I fear I have told you little about Arthur
Machen. Nor am I the only one has confessed such a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
of inadequacy to cope with Machen. But I find comfort in
what a very capable writer once said of another remarkable
writer of Gothic Tales. It will be, I promise you, my final
quotation of the evening. Dorothy Canfield once wrote, in a
preface to <i>Seven Gothic Tales</i>: ‘The person who has set his
teeth into a kind of fruit new to him is usually as eager as
he is unable to tell you how it tastes. It is not enough for him
to be munching away on it with relish. No, he must twist
his tongue trying to get its strange new flavor into words,
which never yet had any power to capture colors or tastes.’
And now, mind the step going out. It’s rather darkish.”</p>

<p>One might devote a great amount of time and give a
great deal of thought to the opening paragraph of a book
about Arthur Machen. It is not merely that one is faced with
the usual problem of where to begin: in Caerleon or London,
in Richmond, Virginia or Newark, New Jersey or, for
that matter, wherever one first heard of or first read Arthur
Machen. Nor is it simply a matter of how to begin: with a
quotation—there are a number of very appropriate quotations—or
with a review of a controversy raging in the London
newspapers in 1915, or with a few paragraphs taken from
<i>Peter Whiffle</i>, a rather outré novel published in New York
some years ago. Nor is it even a matter of when to begin:
with the Nineties, the Twenties, or only yesterday. The
problem is one of selection, for one might pick up the line
of the legend of Arthur Machen anywhere along the course
of the last three quarters of a century. More than that, it is
also a matter of the personal history of almost anyone who
might attempt the task.</p>

<p>Most people will remember, I think, when it was and
how it was, they first became acquainted with the work of
Machen. And in most cases, I believe, it will be a rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
strong and vivid memory. Whether one was introduced to
Machen by Cabell or Starrett or Van Vechten, or made the
discovery for one’s self becomes a matter of some importance,
at least to those who have come to know Machen and who
regard him, as I do, as one of the greatest living writers in
English literature. Yet it might seem that these personal
recollections and this high regard, however deeply felt, are
not quite reason enough for a book about such a man, nor
significant enough to serve as an introduction to such a book.</p>

<p>Of course there are facts and figures. Many a book gets
under way with an impressive array of figures, or with the
clever juxtaposition of two facts which, by their very contrast,
seem to promise an unrelenting interest and an unrelaxing
grasp upon the reader, or it may start out with a
simple statement of fact. Such figures as, for example, these:
Arthur Machen’s works have appeared in anthologies which
run to fabulous numbers of copies, and one of his stories has
been published in an edition limited to two copies. Or a
juxtaposition of facts, as for example: Arthur Machen has
been praised by Oscar Wilde, the arbiter elegantiarum of the
1890’s, and by Walter Winchell, equally arbiter elegantiarum
of the 1930’s.</p>

<p>Or a simple statement of fact, supplied, stiffly and on
crackly paper by the British Ministry of Information: “Arthur
Machen, the Welsh novelist, was born in Caerleon-on-Usk
in 1863.” His Majesty’s Ministry or representative thereof,
concludes with the intelligence that further information may
be found in a certain book which may be obtained from a
certain publisher.</p>

<p>Be it said, then, and to the everlasting glory of His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Majesty’s Ministry of Information, that Arthur Machen <i>was</i>
born at Caerleon-on-Usk. And in the year 1863. A long time
back.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Somerset Maugham once wrote something about the
unhappy accidents of birth that often place a man amid
scenes that must seem forever strange, and among men who
must seem forever strangers. When such a person, after
years of painful adolescence, dramatic conflict, moving
tragedy and innumerable vicissitudes, finally arrives by some
happy accident at some other spot upon this planet he feels,
in the words of more than one sympathetic novelist, that he
has “come home.” And then, presumably, the conflict and
the tragedy and the vicissitudes begin all over again. In
actual life writers, and artists of other sorts, are particularly
susceptible to this form of cosmic accident—or at least many
of them prefer to think so. It is, somehow, heartening to
meet one who was pleased with the place of his birth.</p>

<p>“I shall always,” wrote Arthur Machen, “esteem it as
the greatest piece of fortune that has fallen to me, that I
was born in that noble, fallen Caerleon-on-Usk, in the heart
of Gwent.... For the older I grow the more firmly am I
convinced that anything which I may have accomplished in
literature is due to the fact that when my eyes were first
opened in earliest childhood they saw before them the
vision of an enchanted land.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the simple fact that Arthur
Machen was born in Caerleon-on-Usk has had a tremendous
influence upon his style, his thinking, his writing, his philosophy
and his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>Caerleon-on-Usk, lying within the fabled land of Gwent
and close to the Welsh border, would have fascinated Arthur
Machen even if he had not been born there—just as it
must fascinate everyone who has ever read Machen and
anyone who ever will read him. “Little, white Caerleon,” he
calls it, an island in the green meadows by the river, was
once the headquarters of the Second Augustan Legion, one
of the farthest outposts of the sprawling Roman Empire.
The Romans originally called it Isca Silurum, evidently for its
situation on the river Usk. Later Latin writers called it Urbs
Legionem, a translation of the Welsh Caer-Leon.</p>

<p>Caerleon knew the hardened legionnaires, the men who
crossed the Channel other conquerors failed to cross. It
knew the tread of men who followed the eagles, and it knew
the patricians who came with the Pax Romana in the wake
of the legions. Caerleon knew also the gallant companions
of the Round Table, for it was, in those times, a seat of
Arthur the King, and many a summons brought the knightly
riders within its walls and many a quest sent them off across
the meadows where the river wound in great esses toward
the dark forests hanging along the mountainside. Nennius
places the scene of at least one of Arthur’s battles at Cairlion.
As for Gwent, it is now called Monmouthshire, but in those
days it formed the eastern division of the kingdom of South
Wales, and some identify it as one of the three divisions of
Essyllwg, the country of the Silures. Caerleon itself is the
very stuff of legend, and yet it exists today, as it did in the
middle nineteenth century, a small and sleepy town not far
from the equally legendary Severn.</p>

<p>In this place and in the year 1863, Arthur Machen was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
born—the son of a clergyman who had the poor “living” of
Llanddewi Rectory. His father was John Edward Jones, who
afterwards added his wife’s surname to his own, so that his
son’s full signature became Arthur Llewelyn Jones Machen.
Daniel Jones, Machen’s grandfather, was Vicar of Caerleon-on-Usk
and his great grandfather was David Jones, Curate
of St. Fagans, Glamorgan. It is not the present writer’s intention
to compose a biography, “fictionized” or otherwise, of
Arthur Machen. There will be none of your happy little
phrases about what the “little Arthur” did, or what the
“young Machen” or the “boy Machen” thought. Nor will the
reader be asked to “imagine the young Arthur growing up
amid the storied stones of Caerleon,” or to believe that “undoubtedly
the young Arthur was influenced by the wild Welsh
countryside,” or even to “assume that the boy Machen made
many trips to the legendary shrines in and about Caerleon.”</p>

<p>Such a biography may one day be written, but one cannot
refrain from hoping that it will not be. Machen has written
his own biography in at least three of his books, and perhaps
in all of them. The two frankly autobiographical books,
<i>Far Off Things</i> and <i>Things Near and Far</i> tell most of the
facts of his early life ... and they tell them with more
meaning than even the most skilled and sympathetic biographer
could. His novel, <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>, does more with
the material suggested in these notes of a lifetime than the
most gifted novelist of our day could attempt. The story of
Lucian Taylor and his adventures, mental and physical, mystical
and spiritual, in the invented town of Caermaen, <i>is</i> the
story of Arthur Machen, beautifully told as no one else
could tell it. To these books the reader is referred and, fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
warning, he will be referred to them again and again!</p>

<p>To be sure, Machen <i>did</i> make those little trips about the
legendary town in which he lived; he <i>was</i> inspired by the
storied stones of Caerleon and he <i>was</i> influenced by the wild
Welsh countryside. He was an only child and he lived in that
solitude which is so often the lot of an only child. He often
accompanied his father on his “parish calls” and thus he
came to know every farm and every lane, every hill and
every valley in the heart of Gwent along the roads that led
from the rectory at Llanddewi.</p>

<p>When he was eleven he went away to school, passing
each term as a sort of “interlude among strangers” until he
could come home again to Caerleon. Was he happy or unhappy
at school? Was he fond of games or of mooning
about—the two alternatives, apparently, of English public
school life? That story is told in <i>The Hill of Dreams</i> and
again in <i>The Secret Glory</i>. Machen’s schooldays were the
schooldays of Lucian Taylor and Ambrose Meyrick ... to
their stories we must again refer the reader. For conjecture
and invention are beyond the scope of this study and
Arthur Machen is seventeen when he really enters into our
particular field.</p>

<p>For in his seventeenth year Arthur Machen went up to
London. There was a very practical purpose behind this first
visit to London—he was to come up before the examiners
for entrance into the Royal College of Surgeons. Whether or
not the actual purpose of this visit was of great importance
to Machen is one of the conjectural matters upon which we
shall not speculate. The matter had been arranged and decided
by family and friends—it was the necessary preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
to a career in medicine or in surgery. Machen prepared for it
by walking some three or four miles several times a week
to the Pontypool Road Station to obtain copies of the London
papers. These he studied with great care, devoting
special attention to the theatrical pages. Not that he had
ever given any particular thought to the stage or to the
theater, or that he was, in the phrase of today, “stage-struck”;
it was simply that the theater was typical of what
London was, and of what Caerleon was not. At any rate, on
a day in June 1880, he went up to London with his father.
And thus began The London Adventure.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The examiners found something Machen already knew—he
had no head for figures, either arithmetical or anatomical.
And apparently Machen had not the interest or the ability
to acquire, within a period of time agreeable to the examiners,
a proficiency in either. It must not be assumed, however,
that Arthur Machen had already decided upon a career in
letters, to be pursued amid the pleasures of London. He had
not. Years later Machen wrote that he had no idea, when
first he went to London, of a career in literature. Indeed,
he had <i>never</i> thought of it as a career, but as a destiny.</p>

<p>However, he had not been in London a month before
he began to write. There is nothing particularly prophetic
about this, nor anything especially startling. Most young
men, at one time or another, try to write. And usually their
creative efforts are turned in the direction of the epic, the
heroic, the classic. A young man, trying to write, almost
never permits himself to indulge in a fancy for the light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
essay, the brief episode. It is epic or it is nothing, usually
the latter. Doubtless the Freudians have an explanation
for this. It would be, one supposes, a very long and very
complicated explanation.</p>

<p>Machen had his own explanation—for his own case.
He attributes it to his Celtic blood. Not that Machen thought
the Celt, or the Welsh Celt at any rate, had contributed
much to the world’s literature. Indeed, Machen had advanced
the idea that “all impartial judges will allow that if Welsh
literature were annihilated ... the loss to the world’s grand
roll of masterpieces would be insignificant.” Yet he concedes
a certain literary feeling that does not exist in the
Anglo-Saxon ... an appreciative rather than creative faculty,
lacking, perhaps, in the critical spirit but still, a delight
in the noble phrase ... the music of words. And so—Machen
tried, as a young man will, to write.</p>

<p>He wrote verses, of course. “Every literary career,” says
Machen, “which is to be concerned with the imaginative side
of literature begins with the writing of verses.” So Machen
confirms, some sixty years before it was conceived, the
opinion expressed above. He had written verses before,
while still at the Hereford Cathedral School. They were
concerned somewhat with matters derived from the <i>Mabinogion</i>
and were probably composed in the heroic manner.
This set of verses was, as is the custom, rejected.</p>

<p>He filled notebooks with “horrible rubbish—rubbish that
had rhymes to it.” Much of what he wrote was greatly influenced
by Swinburne’s <i>Songs Before Sunrise</i>. “Influenced”
seems a mild sort of word to set alongside Machen’s own
“cataclysmic.” At any rate, writing what he describes variously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
as rubbish and drivel, Machen tried, at the same time,
to pass his examinations for the Royal College of Surgeons.
His examiners now arrived at their decision regarding
Machen’s arithmetical ability and the career as a surgeon
came to a close. Machen returned to Caerleon and the writing
continued, mostly, of course, after the family had retired
for the night.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>A printer named Jones, who lived in the cathedral town
of Hereford, one day received in the post a manuscript
accompanied by a request to print one hundred copies of
the poem. It was a poem. The title of the poem, <i>Eleusinia</i>,
probably conveyed nothing to Mr. Jones, stationer, bookseller
and printer of Hereford. As he struggled with the
text, written in a large sprawling hand on both sides of
ordinary letter paper, Mr. Jones might have wondered what
our young people were coming to. Certainly the subject
matter of the poem was vastly different from the Bibles,
Prayer Books and Pitman’s Shorthand Manuals with which
his shelves were stocked.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Mr. Jones, the poet pretended no knowledge
of book-making. He specified no typographical niceties,
he pleaded for no ornaments, he indicated no preference
in paper or in binding. His one modest request, that the
Greek phrase <i>Oudeis Muomenos Odureta</i> to appear on
the title page, be set in Greek type, was withdrawn when
Mr. Jones wrote him that Greek type would be extra. And
so the phrase appeared in English, and with a typographical
error, at no extra charge.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones presumably knew the young poet—remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
him as a purchaser of letter paper and note books. The
Llanddewi Rectory address was, in a way, reassuring. His bill
would probably be paid, but Mr. Jones must have thought
the usual thoughts about “minister’s sons.” As for the poet—he
preferred anonymity, the comparative anonymity of “By
a Former Member of the H.C.S.” For when a sixteen page
pamphlet bearing the title <i>Eleusinia</i> and concerning itself
with the Eleusian Mysteries, is published by a Former Member
of the Hereford Cathedral School it must be admitted
that such anonymity is, at best, comparative. Generations of
readers of novels about English public schools will realize
that every other former member of the H.C.S. would know
at once that the book could have been written by none
other than “old Machen.”</p>

<p>Of course the edition of one hundred copies guaranteed
that the anonymity would still remain comparative—especially
since it seemed unlikely that the former membership of
the H.C.S. at large would be interested enough in poetry to
purchase sixteen pages of it ... and without wrappers! It
is not known, exactly, what happened to ninety-nine copies
of <i>Eleusinia</i>. Henry Danielson in his <i>Arthur Machen: A
Bibliography</i> (1923) says that his collation was taken from
what is probably the only copy extant.</p>

<p>The text of this first work of Arthur Machen is, naturally,
as little known to the general reader as a transcription of
the Rosetta Stone ... and so it is likely to remain. What is
it about? Machen says of it, “this is a horrible production.”
He wrote it, he adds, by turning an encyclopedia article on
<i>Eleusis</i> into verse, “some of it blank, some of it rhymed, all
of it bad.” This is Machen’s estimate of it in the notes he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
wrote for Danielson’s <i>Bibliography</i>. Nathan Van Patten
lists, <i>Beneath the Barley. A Note on the Origins of Eleusinia</i>
(1931). Whether this explains the poem or the mysteries is
known only to those who have seen one of the twenty-five
copies that were printed. However, in a letter written in
1945, Machen says: “It is less than nothing, but perhaps it
might have suggested the entertaining question—‘Here is a
boy of seventeen who is interested in the Eleusian Mysteries:
what the devil will happen to him?’”</p>

<p>Well, Machen’s poem was published, and whatever he
may have thought of it in 1923 or in 1945, his relations, in
1884, thought well enough of it to decide that journalism
was the career for Arthur. It is amazing, in a way, that a
pleasant little group in a country rectory should decide over
a little pamphlet written “about” the pagan rites at Eleusis,
that their youthful relative was destined for a career in
journalism. Of course, relatives are proud of one’s books and
equally proud of one’s pamphlets, even if they do not read
them. And so, perhaps, the rector and his family never
bothered too much about the contents of the rarest Machen
item of them all. Doubtless more than one of the ninety-nine
copies slowly disintegrates in a Welsh garret to this very day.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1881 Machen was back in London in
quest of a career. This one too, although it had nothing to
do with figures, did not quite come off. For some time he
had thought about journalism as his relatives advised, but
he did not actually follow their advice until some years later.
Meanwhile, he lived in an old red-brick Georgian house in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Turnham Green where he wrote furiously in one manner
or another. That Celtic appreciation of the fine phrase and
the glorious sound of words was strong within him, for almost
everything he read struck a responsive chord, and he
would begin at once to compose an epic in the manner of
the author or the book he was currently reading.</p>

<p>Thus there was a long heroic poem in the manner of
William Morris, whose <i>Earthly Paradise</i> he had just purchased
with his tea and tobacco money. Then there were innumerable
verses in the manner of Robert Herrick. Now and
then there would be a strong Swinburnian resurgence. And
while all this furious creation was going on he worked in
what was called the “editorial” department of a publishing
house.</p>

<p>There are many tasks a literary man might do in serving
his apprenticeship and Machen did most of them—or most
of the ones current in the ’Eighties. He had assisted in the
“grangerizing” of many old and odd volumes and he had
composed “Shakespearean” calendars, selecting appropriate
quotations from “The Bard” for each of the three hundred
and sixty-five days. These and other more or less literary
matters occupied his days and earned for him the sum of
about a pound a week. At Turnham Green he wrote feverishly
and planned prodigiously and read ravenously ... and
almost every book he came upon set him off on another venture
of his own.</p>

<p>There are some writers, and there are certain casts of
mind, requiring exercises of this sort. It is rather odd that
these should turn out to be the more imaginative writers
after all. Yet it does seem that they have to work out for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
themselves theories of composition and devote much of their
time and talent and energy to perfecting the technicalities of
the trade of writing. Poe, of course, comes to mind, and
Coleridge and Hawthorne. They first developed theories,
seemingly so rigid. They devised formulae, seemingly so
mechanical. And then they created tales and poems, not from
their observations and experience, based not on facts, but on
fancy. And they composed them, apparently, with little regard
for the formulae and systems of their own devising.
They seem to leap from the frankly imitative to the fearlessly
imaginative, without ever taking any of the intermediate
steps they themselves had postulated, or calling into
use any of the technical and mechanical aids with which
they had practiced their trade.</p>

<p>Machen in 1881 might recognize and respond to a
pattern or formula in Swinburne, in Burton, in Morris, in
Herrick, in Stevenson, in Balzac, in Rabelais. This is not to
imply that Machen merely developed a style “in the manner
of Swinburne,” or of Stevenson or of any of them. To each
of these he brought something of Machen—and as he learned
his craft, the technical tricks, the automatic alliterations and
the polished phrasing were fused into something, a way of
writing, no one else has ever had, no one but Arthur Machen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Machen discovered that he disliked his
labours at the publishing house in Chandos Street. The
business of composing cultural calendars to be hung in London
kitchens and country parlours did not interest him, nor
did he see why it should interest anyone. He therefore resigned
his position—and in the face of a raise to twenty-four
shillings a week! He then became, of all things, tutor to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
group of children, teaching them, of all things, mathematics!
His head for figures seems to have improved considerably
for, on going over the Euclid he was supposed to pass along
to his charges, he found that it did make sense of a sort.</p>

<p>He had moved from Turnham Green to Clarendon
Road—a street destined to become, one day, as well known
as Baker Street, Cheyne Row and many another London
street of literary fame. Machen was already existing on that
famous and fantastic diet of “green tea, stale bread and great
quantities of tobacco.” Fortunately, at first, his tutorial position
entitled him to dinner with his pupils. Later his pupils
changed, and with them his menu. The noon hour was spent
in wandering about Turnham Green or Holland Park, with
a pause for biscuit and beer at a convenient tavern.</p>

<p>These wanderings became a habit, and through the
spring of 1883 Machen went further afield into the green
suburbs to the north and west of the city. It was on these
lonely outings that he first began to formulate one of his
literary theories—that “in literature no imaginative effects
are achieved through logical predetermination.” Now this
theory—so demonstrably true in his own case—was arrived
at by no logical predetermination but by sheer pedestrianism.
It came about on these solitary walks when, as so often happened,
the roads that led so invitingly to green and open
country plunged suddenly into a row of horribly new brick
houses or, more startling still, a vast and sprawling cemetery.</p>

<p>To the countryman, whose ideal landscape proceeds
logically from valley to hill, from stream to pond, from crossroads
to village, from fence to house and stile to pasture,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
these monstrous outcroppings of civilization, these sudden
and terrible interruptions of what was and should have continued
to be a pleasant prospect, are more horrible even than
a factory belching smoke from seven stacks.</p>

<p>And so these pleasant saunters that so often ended before
a hideous row of red-brick houses, the quiet lanes that
terminated abruptly before a vast pile of bricks and boards,
created in Machen the beginnings of that doctrine of the
strange and terrifying things that lie so close to the surface
of the quiet and the commonplace. The hideous face at the
window in a story written years later is but a reflection of the
sudden apparition of a raw, new suburb at the end of a quiet
lane leading north out of London.</p>

<p>For the present these were but things seen and felt, they
sank quietly below the surface and floated deep down in the
well of the unconscious. Tutoring and Turnham Green and
the twisting roads of Notting Hill were sufficient unto the
days. The nights in his small room in Clarendon Road were
more urgent—more filled with magic. For here there was
not the sudden sight of a street hastily hacked into a hillside,
nor the mounds and monuments of a cemetery, but great
books and greater magic flowing from the majesty of Gothic
cathedrals or the Arthurian romances or the Divine Comedy.
He read by night, lighting candles when the gas meter clicked
off, and passed for a time into the “Middle Ages, walking in
the silvery light with the Masters of the Sentences, with the
Angelic Doctor, listening to the high interminable argument
of the Schools.” Out of these books and studies, and a great
deal out of Burton’s <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> came a book
that was to be called <i>The Anatomy of Tobacco</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>The book was sent to a publisher who, as it happened,
liked it and who was prepared to publish it, after “certain
preliminaries” were attended to. These preliminaries entailed
a visit to Caerleon and called for another conference
in the parlour at the Rectory. The family and the relations,
remembering the pamphlet of a few years ago and encouraged
by the news that the new book would contain many
times more than sixteen pages, attended to the preliminaries.</p>

<p>In due course, in the year 1884, George Redway of London
published <i>The Anatomy of Tobacco</i>. And a very handsome
book it was, in its cream parchment boards and brick-red
lettering on the spine. The author of this study of smoking,
“Methodized, Divided, and Considered after a New
Fashion” was one “Leolinus Silurensis, Professor of Fumical
Philosophy in the University of Brentford,” in whom we
may recognize our old friend, the former Member of the
Hereford Cathedral School.</p>

<p>This is the book Machen calls “The Anatomy of
Tankards” in his <i>Far Off Things</i>. There you may read the
whys and the wherefores of this amazing composition, and
the devious means by which Burton and tobacco and divers
other curious books entered into its making. So convincing
is his account of his investigations and research into the matter
of taverns and tankards and such matters that quite a
few collectors have spent considerable time, and were prepared
to spend considerable sums, to acquire a copy of <i>The
Anatomy of Tankards</i>. Meanwhile, Machen had quitted the
six-by-ten room in the Clarendon Road and returned to
Caerleon and a normal diet. Throughout the winter of 1884
he had worked on the proofs of the <i>Anatomy</i> and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
upon an assignment from Redway for another book. This
was a translation of the <i>Heptameron</i> of Marguerite of Navarre.
Machen blithely undertook the task, despite his own
sworn statement that upon leaving Hereford School he
could not have conjugated the simplest, and most popular,
of French verbs.</p>

<p>The merrie and delightsome tales of the French Marguerite
occupied him through winter and spring in Gwent.
Once more he walked in the deep lanes about Caerleon and
alternately missed London and revelled in the luxury of not
being in Clarendon Road. By the time June came to Caerleon
he had sent off the last batch of his translation and
Redway had written him and offered him a job. It did not
seem too hard a thing to return to Clarendon Road with a
job, a real one, in the City. He was to catalogue books—and
such books! There were books on Alchemy and Magic, on
Mysteries and Ancient Worship, on the occult sciences and
Rosicrucians and all sorts of wonderful and baleful and
mystic and incredible matters.</p>

<p>Machen became the cataloguer of these curious volumes—and
he came very close to being that wonderful
phenomena of the twentieth century: a publisher’s advertising
man! As a matter of fact, Machen did achieve something
few, if any, publisher’s advertising men have accomplished—either
before or since. Two of his catalogues have become
highly prized collector’s items. They were published in 1887
and 1888 respectively.</p>

<p>Working in a book-filled garret in Catherine Street,
Machen produced one catalogue which pops up from time
to time in Machen bibliographies: <i>The Literature of Occultism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and Archeology</i>. Then it occurred to him to paraphrase
a chapter in <i>Don Quixote</i>, the one in which the Curate and
the Barber examine the Knight’s library. This chapter was
written in a manner calculated to entice the wary or unwary
book collector into buying the books discussed. The catalogue
was issued under the title <i>A Chapter from the Book Called
The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote de la Mancha</i>. The
other catalogue, issued in the following year, bore the title
<i>Thesaurus Incantatus, The Enchanted Treasure or, The
Spagyric Quest of Beroaldus Cosmopolita</i>.</p>

<p>It will do little good to look for copies of these catalogues.
Vincent Starret, the fortunate possessor of at least
one of them, in his collection of Machen’s tales, <i>The Shining
Pyramid</i> (Covici-Fried, Chicago, 1923) has included two
pieces called <i>The Priest and the Barber</i> and <i>The Spagyric
Quest of Beroaldus Cosmopolita</i>. These are taken, of course,
from the catalogues in question. As to whether you will find
the Starret volumes readily available—well, they are worth
the search.</p>

<p>Well then, here was Machen in a hot-bed of the occult
and the devilish, surrounded by books of all sorts, especially
the strange, the weird and the curious. His room in
the Clarendon Road held as many books as it could accommodate
along with its occupant—the overflow was
stacked between the rungs of a ladder on the landing outside.
He was busy with notebooks once more, and writing
furiously as ever—but in despair rather than the fine frenzy
and high spirits of a few years before. For now he was deep
in Rabelais and Balzac—and these books cast a spell upon
him. They were warm, glowing books in which life was full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and rich and lusty—there were great eaters and drinkers
and lovers in those days. They offered too great a contrast
to the cold, lonely room in Clarendon Road and the diet of
tea, tobacco and bread.</p>

<p>Machen was under the spell of a landscape bathed in a
warm sun, with ruins standing close to roads, and wine flowing
from vineyard to bottle to parched throats all within a
few yards of enchanted space. This was a contrast indeed to
the deep lanes of Gwent, the lonely ruins that stood in the
shade and shadow of great hills and forests, and although
Machen had spoken glowingly of the greenish-yellow cider
of that land, still, he rather favored, in his mind at least, the
wines of Touraine.</p>

<p>By night there was this magic of old books and by day
there were the old books of magic, for the garret in Catherine
Street was crowded with old and odd books of every sort, a
collection that “represented that inclination of the human
mind which may be a survival from the rites of the black
swamp and the cave.” These studies did induce a frame of
mind that might tend toward the strange and unusual. Living
in this strange mixture of a glowing, gargantuan landscape
and the dark labyrinths of the mediaeval mind, Machen
tried, and sometimes desperately tried, to write.</p>

<p>“A man has no business to write,” said Machen many
years later, “unless he has something in his heart, which, he
feels cries out to be expressed.” And he had nothing to say—had
only the urge to write, the vice of writing for writing’s
sake—<i>cacoethes scribendi</i>—he called it! But then Machen
has had time to reconsider his pronouncement of 1923, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
to revise his opinion regarding men who wrote—and why
they write.</p>

<p>In a “London Letter” to the <i>New York Times Book
Section</i>, Herbert W. Horwill wrote, in September 1935: “A
curious literary problem is posed by that veteran author,
Arthur Machen, in John o’ London’s Weekly. Imagine a
man marooned on a desert island, and certain that he would
remain there for the rest of his life. Imagine, moreover, that
he possessed the literary faculty, and had salvaged pens, ink
and paper from the wreck or else had devised home-made
substitutes for them. Would such a man write, knowing that
whatever he wrote would never be seen by any eye but his
own?</p>

<p>“Mr. Machen tells us that he once heard this question
discussed among a group of friends. Some answered yes and
some no, and, when pipes were knocked out for the night,
the problem was no nearer solution, though, to the best of
his recollection, the ayes were in the majority. He voted with
them himself, and, after further reflection, he still believes
he was right. The hypothetical Crusoe might have no better
implements available than quills of parrots’ feathers, paper
made out of the bark of the guru tree and ink obtained by
macerating the root of a certain plant. But, granted his
possession of the literary faculty, he would possess also the
literary impulse. He would write because he liked writing,
apart from whatever fate might be in store for the thing
written. The true spring of imaginative literature, Mr.
Machen reminds us, is the delight of the creator in creation.”</p>

<p>In the desert island of Clarendon Road, all through the
summer of 1885, Machen wrote. He wrote because he had to,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
because he was under the spell of a master of gargantuan
languages, because he was enamoured of the sound of words
and because he had an ear for the rich and rolling phrase.
And, of course, he wrote because he had the literary impulse.
The pound a week he was paid by Redway could not afford
him the rich living, the pleasures of Touraine. But then,
after despair and after much almost pointless scribbling, he
came at last upon the idea for the Great Romance.</p>

<p>It was to be a book in which Rabelais and Gwent were
mingled ... and thus began the “History of the Nine Joyous
Journeys ... in which were contained the amorous
inventions and fanciful tales of Master Gervase Perrot,
Gent.” Machen had prepared for this great undertaking by
purchasing his ruled quarto paper, his pen points and his
penholders. Quite possibly he envisioned a plaque on the
door of his little cell at 23 Clarendon Road, announcing that
Here Had the Great Romance been Written! There was,
however, this difficulty—the vision of the great romance
declined to be more specific. There were no hints as to plot,
no guidance as to characters. He began, at any rate, a Prologue,
written in a flowing and flowery 17th Century manner.</p>

<p>But now his cataloguing in Catherine Street had come to
an end, and with it his pound or thereabouts per week. Nevertheless,
he wrote on, even though he knew that his composition
of the Great Romance might be abruptly terminated some
three or four days in the future. Then, presumably, he would
return to Caerleon, in all probability on foot. As it happened,
he returned hurriedly by train. Just as he had come to the
end of his tea and tobacco and rent money, he had word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
that his mother was dying. Aunt Maria thoughtfully sent
his fare with the summons.</p>

<p>Later, he returned to the “great romance,” writing once
more in the familiar room in the rectory where the fire burned
and the winds howled down from Twyn Barlwyn and tossed
the branches and beat upon the door. He wrote late into the
morning, long after his father had knocked out his last pipe
and gone upstairs. So passed the winter of 1885. Through
the days he walked in the lovely Gwentian hills and looked
down upon the white farm houses standing in the midst of
encircling trees. At night he worked in that room where
he had, as a boy, first read de Quincy and Scott and the
other writers who had helped to bring about the “renascence
of wonder.” And in the following year he was alone. His
father died that spring.</p>

<p>This was the John Edward Jones whose homecoming
from Jesus College, Oxford, is described in the opening
pages of <i>Things Near and Far</i>. Now Machen was more truly
alone than ever. His father had been to him a good companion
in his earliest rambles about the countryside. It had
been his father’s hope that Arthur might one day return to
Gwent to live, buy a small newspaper and settle down to a
quiet career in country journalism.</p>

<p>There were certain inheritances that might help, when
they came through. For Machen’s father seldom thought of
the good these inheritances would do for him in his struggle
to make ends meet at Llanddewi Rectory. But now he had
gone and then, ironically, the long-lived Scottish relations
went too, and the Scottish lawyers began to look through
family Bibles for the next of kin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Through these and other circumstances Machen at
length came into money—smallish amounts which, shrewdly
invested or even conservatively invested, might have stretched
themselves out for a score or more years. This economic
policy did not suggest itself or, if it did, was quietly ignored.
The simple expedient of living modestly and comfortably,
and dipping into a box for coins, when coins were required,
seemed much the better plan.</p>

<p>In 1887 Machen returned to London, to live in Bedford
Place, and to arrange for the publication of the Great Romance,
now called <i>The Chronicle of Clemendy</i>. This was
accomplished, with perhaps a deeper plunge into the box of
coins, and the book was published that year. It was printed
at Carbonnek, “for the society of Pantagruelists.” And it
did, apparently, quite well. The nine joyous journeys and the
merry monks of Abergavenny pleased Machen and his fellow
Pantagruelists—which, in the year 1888 or 1948, is almost
as much as can be asked of any book.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>In the late 1880’s Arthur Machen had, as he said,
“Rabelais on the brain.” He had been for some years under
the spell of the gargantuan tales and of Balzac’s <i>Contes Drolatiques</i>—and
perhaps even more under the spell, literarily if
not literally, of the Holy Bottle and the magic of Touraine
and whatever it is about the land of France that so beguiles
the young of the Anglo-Saxon peoples.</p>

<p>It was under the Rabelaisian influence that Machen had
written his “great Romance,” <i>The Chronicle of Clemendy</i>,
and made his translation of the <i>Heptameron</i>. And finally he
had undertaken to translate and publish an even more difficult
and bizarre book—<i>Le Moyen de Parvenir</i> by Beroalde
de Verville.</p>

<p>This book, rather highly prized by collectors of at least
two sorts, is incredibly dull. No fault of Machen’s certainly,
although he might have permitted it to remain untranslated.
Still, he was at the stage and of an age when this sort of
thing had an appeal. And so he translated and published it
in not one, but two editions. There was a large paper edition
and an “ordinary” edition—both preceded by a very small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
edition (four copies) of a portion of the book under the title
<i>The Way to Attain</i>.</p>

<p>Now of course every Machen bibliography lists this title,
and many a Machenite has wished he might obtain a copy.
Actually, it is one of the least important of Machen’s works.
For this is merely a portion of <i>Le Moyen de Parvenir</i>—and
very probably not an important part at that. Bibliographers,
bibliophiles and bibliomaniacs are at liberty to go quietly
mad in their quest for this queer little item. For queer it is—Machen
himself cannot quite explain its existence. The four
copies were issued in 1889, presumably by the Dryden Press
who were to publish the complete work. A dispute over
something or other arose and the project was dropped—at
least by the Dryden Press. All four copies, apparently, are in
the safe-keeping of Danielson, or they were at one time.</p>

<p>The other two editions were privately printed at Carbonnek
in 1890 under the title of <i>Fantastic Tales</i>. There have
been other editions, de luxe if not luxurious, for what is
sometimes known as “the trade.” It may be assumed that
the writer holds no very high opinion of this work. But then
neither does Machen. He has described the book as being
somewhat like a cathedral constructed entirely of gargoyles—as
plain a warning as any ever given by an author regarding
one of his works.</p>

<p>This fantastic collection of “discourses ... on Reformation
politics ... many tales, some pointless, a few amusing”
while it may provide puzzles, pleasure and profit for
bibliophiles, is important only in that it marks the finish of
the Rabelaisian influence upon Machen. Not that this influence
was ever “Rabelaisian” in the usual sense ... it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
rather like that of various French poets and novelists of several
generations over still other generations of English and
American writers. During certain periods our younger writers
and “intellectuals” would have Verlaine on the brain, or
Baudelaire in their bonnets, but eventually they would go
back to writing stark novels about Sussex or Sauk Center,
or Wales or Wisconsin or the moors of the Missouri.</p>

<p>The extent of this enthusiasm and the depth of this
influence may be estimated from the following rhapsody
delivered by Ambrose Meyrick in <i>The Secret Glory</i>. “Let me
celebrate, above all, the little red wine. Not in any mortal
vineyard did its father grape ripen; it was not nourished by
the warmth of the visible sun, nor were the rains that made it
swell common waters from the skies above us. Not even in
the Chinonnais, earth sacred though that be, was the press
made that caused its juices to be poured into the <i>cuve</i>, nor
was the humming of its fermentation heard in any of the
good cellars of the lower Touraine. But in that region which
Keats celebrates when he sings the ‘Mermaid Tavern’ was
this juice engendered—the vineyard lay low down in the
south, among the starry plains where is the <i>Terra Turonensis
Celestis</i>, that unimaginable country which Rabelais beheld in
his vision where mighty Gargantua drinks from inexhaustible
vats eternally, where Pantagruel is athirst for evermore,
though he be satisfied continually. There, in the land of the
Crowned Immortal Tosspots was that wine of ours vintaged,
red with the rays of the Dog-star, made magical by the influence
of Venus, fertilised by the happy aspect of Mercury.
O rare, super-abundant and most excellent juice, fruit of all
fortunate stars, by thee were we translated, exalted into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
fellowship of that Tavern of which the old poet writes:
<i>Mihi est propositum in Taberna mori!</i>”</p>

<p>Well, it was quite a thing while it lasted ... but the
Rabelaisian vein petered out and Machen began to perceive
that he was of Caerleon-on-Usk and not a townsman of Tours
or a citizen of Chinon, and that the old grey manor-houses
and the white farms of Gwent had their beauty and significance,
though they were not castles in Touraine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was back at his old trade of cataloguing.
He had switched employers for, when York Street would
yield little more than a pound a week, Leicester Square
would give thirty shillings. So back he went to cataloguing
ancient books. Not that he was much good at it, nor that he
preferred it above all other forms of employment. As a matter
of fact he rather disapproved of the whole business and
issued what almost amounts to a Manifesto to Collectors: “I
don’t care two-pence,” he wrote, “whether a book is in the
first edition or in the tenth; nay, if the tenth is the best edition,
I would rather have it ... the only question being: is
the book worth reading or not?”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, cataloguing seems to have been a rather
flourishing trade at the time, and a profitable practice—for
the publisher at any rate. For this was a remarkably literate
era, and publishers pandered profitably to the popular taste
... they were busily at work discovering rare books, improving
some with plates borrowed from others, issuing new
and enlarged editions at the drop of a folio, and discovering
the pleasures and profits to be derived from making translations—particularly
from the French. In the same building
occupied by Machen’s employers were the offices of Vizatelly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the publisher who was even then bringing out translations of
Zola’s works. At about the same time Machen was working
there, Havelock Ellis was editing the Mermaid Tavern Series
of Elizabethan Dramatists for Vizatelly. Ellis notes in his
<i>Autobiography</i> that he was paid the sum of three guineas per
volume—an amount he considered rather small. This may
indeed have been a small amount—but he had a better deal
of it than Machen who was asked, at about this time, to do
a translation of the memoirs of Casanova.</p>

<p>The manner in which this undertaking came about was
rather curious and very casual. One of the Brothers for
whom he worked, and whom he does not otherwise identify
in <i>Things Near and Far</i>, came to him one day with an old
volume and asked Machen to translate from the place marked
with a slip of paper. Machen set to work and about a year
later he completed his translation of the twelve volumes of
<i>Casanova’s Memoirs</i>. The place marked fell in about the
fifth volume, and Machen simply translated through to the
twelfth, began again at the first and worked through to
the place in the fifth volume—which was “where he came
in” as one says at the movies.</p>

<p>This monumental work, and the best translation to
date of the <i>Memoirs</i>, was thrown in, as it were, with the
cataloguing at thirty shillings a week. Machen simply remarks
that he believes the cost to the firm to have been
“strictly moderate.” Much more moderate than the three
guineas per volume paid to Ellis for his editing. However,
Machen was eventually offered an opportunity of profiting
from his work. A few years later when the translation was
about to be published, Machen was granted the privilege of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
investing a thousand pounds in the venture. One of the
Brothers suggested that, as he was now an <i>interested</i> party,
he might wish to revise the manuscript.</p>

<p>Of course publishing was not quite the same game it
is today ... there were publishers then who were, if not
actually unscrupulous, a trifle careless in their accounting
and possibly slightly unethical. Vizatelly was prosecuted
and jailed as a result of his translations of Zola. Machen has
remarked upon the irony of the situation—for even while
Vizatelly was in jail, charged with circulating obscene literature,
Zola was being well received on his trip through England.
When Vizatelly died shortly thereafter the Mermaid
Tavern series was taken over by another publisher without so
much as a by-your-leave. Ellis’ name was removed from the
volumes, and that, apparently, settled that. Ellis treated the
affair with a silence he knew would not be taken as a sign of
contempt. One gathers that publishers in those days were not
very thin-skinned. However, in his autobiographical sketches
describing these events, Machen offers not the slightest criticism
of the Brothers but he did, shortly thereafter, quit the
publishing business.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>For almost a decade Machen had been in London, and
for most of that time he had been writing. But he had written
rather imitatively; he had, as he says, “been wearing
costume in literature. The rich, figured English of the earlier
17th Century had a peculiar attraction....” Whether this
was unnatural affectation or natural affinity, he wrote in this
fashion—essays, verse, tales, epistols dedicatory. He even
kept, for many years, a diary written in this manner. <i>The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Anatomy of Tobacco</i> was an “exercise in the antique,” the
<i>Chronicle</i> tried to be mediaeval, <i>Le Moyen</i> was in the ancient
mode, the <i>Heptameron</i> a mere finger-exercise in the
composition of a period piece. At this point Machen decided
to write in the modern manner.</p>

<p>In 1890 Machen began to make an approach to journalism.
His Welsh relations were probably gratified when his
pieces and stories began to appear in the Globe and the St.
James Gazette. He was still a long way from adopting
journalism as a profession or career, but he had decided to
do some writing in “the modern manner” and the papers
seemed to offer an outlet.</p>

<p>Journalism was then, as it is now, a wonderfully agitated
world in which editors knew what their readers wanted
and were determined to see that they got it—whether they
liked it or not. Oddly enough, an editor’s staff never seems
to have this happy faculty of knowing what the readers
want, but they do know what their editors want—and so
everyone is mildly unhappy about it excepting the editors—and
it is questionable whether an editor is ever really happy,
or ever deserves to be.</p>

<p>At any rate Machen wrote, on an average, about as
much drivel as the average journalist must, and about as
many silly stories as most journalists have to. Of course it
was not as bad as it might have been, or as bad as it became
later, for, according to Machen, editors in the 1890’s presumed
a certain standard of education and culture in their
readers. This tendency has been overcome, however, and
along with certain other technical improvements the press
as it existed during Machen’s time was much as it is today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>His success at writing for the Globe and an acceptance
by the St. James Gazette started him on short stories. These
appeared mostly in the Gazette whose rate of payment was
commendably higher than the Globe’s. The connection did
not last too long for one of the stories created quite a stir.</p>

<p>Reading it now one wonders at that, and when one
remembers a few of the tales that were to flourish in the
decade to follow, Machen’s little story of <i>The Double Return</i>
seems harmless enough. The tale is rather reminiscent of <i>The
Guardsman</i>—you will remember the success of the Lunts in
that play on the stage and on the screen. Machen’s tale
lacked the amorousness or even the intent of <i>The Guardsman</i>,
it merely told of a man returning home after three weeks in
the country.</p>

<p>“Back so soon?” asked his wife.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in the country for three weeks,” said he,
rather put out.</p>

<p>“I know,” she said, “but you returned last night.”</p>

<p>“Indeed not, I spent last night at Plymouth on my way
back from the country,” said the husband.</p>

<p>Whereupon his wife accused him of being playful
and showed him his cigarette case he had left behind him
when he left the house this very morning. Well, the husband
had lost the cigarette case in the country some days before,
and he <i>had</i> spent the night in Plymouth on his way back to
London, and so he couldn’t have returned on the previous
night. There had been a man at his hotel or inn who rather
resembled him and so on. The upshot of it all was that shortly
thereafter the husband went to America, which seems to
have been the thing to do in such cases. A rather harmless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
little story, not even a boudoir scene or a hint of one. But <i>The
Double Return</i> aroused as much interest in the nineties as the
most daring double entendre might today.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde, no amateur at arousing the public, said
to Machen, “Are you the author of that story that fluttered
the dovecotes? I thought it very good.” Well, flutter the
dovecotes it did, and one did not flutter the dovecotes with
impunity, at least so far as the St. James Gazette was concerned.
Machen no longer appeared in its august pages. This
may or may not have caused Machen concern. He was also
doing stories for some of the “society” papers and wrote in
this same year <i>The Lost Club</i>, so very similar to Stevenson’s
story of the Suicide Club, <i>A Wonderful Woman</i> and others.</p>

<p>The year 1890 happens to be a year of some significance
generally, for it opens the decade of the delicate decadents,
sometimes known as the Yellow Book Boys.</p>

<p>Among the many books that have been written about
the Eighteen Nineties is a small and, on the whole, less pretentious
volume than most. This is Bernard Muddiman’s
<i>Men of the Nineties</i>. In it one finds this brief mention of
Machen: “Arthur Machen, in those days, belonged to the
short story writers with Hubert Crackanthorpe, who was the
great imaginative prose writer of the group.”</p>

<p>Alas, poor Hubert! Who knows him today as a great
imaginative prose writer? Who, for that matter, knows
poor Hubert at all, save for those who may look into the
bound volumes of the Yellow Book to be found occasionally
in the Public Library (under the somewhat bewildering
though accurate classification of “Magazines”)?</p>

<p>The 1890’s was perhaps the most widely and well publicized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
decade in history, surpassing, in this respect at least,
the ’Twenties of our own century. The 1890’s spawned
geniuses where the 1920’s only discovered genius. The
analogy between these decades can be carried to even greater
lengths and indeed it will be, in a later chapter, for the
’Twenties also rediscovered Arthur Machen.</p>

<p>But for all poor Muddiman’s eulogy of Hubert in his
slender volume eulogizing the men of the Nineties, the late
Mr. Crackanthorpe was <i>not</i> the great imaginative prose
writer of the group. Nor was the prolific Henry Harland,
whose contributions to the Yellow Book were in the New
Style—with French phrases popping up half a dozen to the
page and French women putting in appearance among the
good English spinneys, and representative members of the
New Woman being forthright and outspoken for all their
“flutter of curls at the brow” and garden hats and “merry
peals of laughter.” Mr. Harland sprinkled his prose with
French phrases, giving them a naughty air (just as, in the
Twenties, French phrases were used to give novels a sophisticated
air) and his heroes were made “interesting” rather
than solid or adventurous or empire building. They, the
“interesting” chaps, thought of women as “handsome” or
“good-looking” rather than beautiful or lovely. Such words
were reserved for inanimate things—things animal, vegetable
or mineral, but never the feminine. They further thought
of women in terms of “what a <i>woman</i> she is!” Like that,
with an air of invincible surprise. No, it was not Hubert, nor
yet Henry, who was the great imaginative prose writer of
the group—it was Arthur Machen. But then Muddiman may
have been right after all, for Machen was not truly of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
group of writers who practiced the purple phrase, who
wrote in pastels and who composed pastiches in praise of
practically nothing.</p>

<p>It may come as something of a surprise to many admirers
of Machen to know that he was a contemporary of the
Yellow Book crowd. Perhaps it will come as something of a
relief to know that Machen was not a member of the group,
despite the fact that his first book of stories appeared in this
period, issuing from the Bodley Head with a title page by
Beardsley. Machen never wrote for the Yellow Book. But
for that matter, neither did Wilde. Still, yellow bookery was
rampant at the time and since it is sometimes said that a man
is the product of his age, it might be well to skirt along the
well travelled path trod by the delicate decadents, their
critics and appraisers and appreciators.</p>

<p>Osburt Burdett, Holbrook Jackson, Richard LeGallienne
and other more talented and serious students have gone
over the period with admirable thoroughness. The magnifying
glass has been placed over every one of Beardsley’s
drawings and even the most moribund of the minor poets
has been the subject of at least one monograph. Still, it will
be interesting to review briefly what has been said of the
men of the Nineties, if only because it may be applied, with
certain changes and reservations, to the Twenties and, for
that matter, to the period which we are about to enter. For
the birth of the Atomic Age, for all its violent and destructive
debut, cannot have been more shocking, in some respects,
than the impact of the coterie of the green carnation upon
the Victorianism of the Nineties.</p>

<p>The group known as the Yellow Book boys, or the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
of the Nineties, or the delicate decadents were, as Donald
Davidson has remarked, “time-conscious” to an intense degree.
They were nearing the end of a century, just as the
men of the Twenties lived through the end of an epoch and
the men of the Forties enter a new one. There is still, you
see, this strange analogy between the “Tragic Generation”
as the men of the Nineties called themselves, and the “Lost
Generation” as the men of the Twenties called themselves.
Whether or not there will be a continuing analogy between
the three decades is an interesting speculation, but quite
beyond the scope of this study. Or is it?</p>

<p>The men of the Nineties were time-conscious to an
intense degree and they were self-conscious to an even greater
degree. Being young men, for one thing, and acutely
aware of the Victorianism of their Victorian age for another,
and rather preoccupied with the importance of being
earnest and alive in the closing years of a century for still
another, they were rather more self-conscious than most
young men.</p>

<p>Now it is an odd thing, when one considers it, that
the young and self-conscious members of the Anglo-Saxon
races, in whatever age, discover in themselves a remarkable
affinity and a positive predilection for the culture and customs
of France. This happens time and again, and whenever it
does happen it is accompanied by a profound contempt for
the Anglo-Saxonishness of their Anglo-Saxon contemporaries
and compatriots. No doubt there are excellent reasons for
this. It is a strange thing, but it is by no means unusual, since
it has happened with something very much like regularity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
ever since William the Norman crossed the Channel—and
perhaps even before that.</p>

<p>The Saxon nobles who set themselves apart from the
peasantry were probably the first to adopt the manners and
language of the Norman court. Almost any intrigue current
at the time, or for the next few centuries, seemed the
more likely to succeed if it acquired a dash of the Gallic.
Even in that most English of all English periods, the age of
Elizabeth, the young blades and the intellectuals felt the
more dashing and, presumably, the more intellectual for a
smattering of French oaths and a short time spent in the
courts or chateaux of France, or the alleys and marketplaces
of Paris.</p>

<p>Well, then, the men of the Nineties acquired their
smattering of French and their translations of Baudelaire and
Verlaine and felt the better for them ... much as our men
of the Twenties rode the cattle-boats to the Left Bank and
wrote the “only American literature” of their day. Little
magazines sprang up in the Nineties, verse grew steadily
more <i>libre</i>, and there was little difference, spiritually at any
rate, between the Bodley Head in 1890 and the Shakespeare
Head in 1920 or thereabouts. Another lost, tragic generation
of self-conscious Anglo-Saxons had “found themselves”—and
France.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>To return to the Nineties. There were those, even then,
who suspected that something was up in the state of English
literature. Grave and scholarly men analyzed the state of
affairs and speculated on causes and results. If the young
men were pleased with themselves there were others who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
were not. There was a certain looseness of thinking and of
phrasing that was not universally approved. The burden of
such critical attitudes is a familiar one—it is the one that
attends all new movements in literature, following change
as the night follows the day.</p>

<p>The first and best expressed of these critical appraisals
appeared in, of all places, the first volume of the <i>Yellow
Book</i> itself. Advocating “Reticence in Literature,” Arthur
Waugh wrote: “During the last quarter of a century ...
the English man of letters has been indulging, with an entirely
new freedom, his national birthright of outspokenness,
and during the last twelve months there have been no
uncertain indications that this freedom of speech is degenerating
into license which some of us cannot but view with
regret and apprehension.” A familiar note, an old refrain!</p>

<p>“The writers and the critics of contemporary literature
have, it would seem, alike lost their heads; they have gone
out into the byways and hedges in search of the new thing,
and have brought into the study and subjected to the microscope
mean objects of the roadside, whose analysis may be
of value to science but is absolutely foreign to art.”</p>

<p>Mr. Waugh then proceeds to make the point that every
great productive period of literature has been the result of
some internal or external revulsion of feeling, some current
of ideas. The great periods of productivity had been those
when the national mind had been directed to some vast
movement of emancipation, the discovery of new countries,
the defeat of old enemies, the opening of fresh possibilities.
But, Waugh remonstrates, the past quarter of a century had
been sterile of important improvements, there had been no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
new territories and no new knowledge. Because of this sterility
the minds of writers had been thrown back upon themselves
and the most characteristic literature of the day had
become introspective.</p>

<p>“Following one course,” says Waugh, “it has betaken
itself to that analytical fiction which we associate primarily
with America; following another course, it has sought for
subject matter in the discussing of passions and sensations,
common, doubtless, to every age of mankind, interesting and
necessary, too, in their way, but passions and sensations hitherto
disassociated with literature.”</p>

<p>It will be noted that Waugh attributes a certain regrettable
trend to American sources, but then he later says that
the tendency for literary frankness had its origins in Swinburne.
Despite the accuracy of many points made by Waugh,
it must be noted that the world in 1890 was not quite the
uneventful place it seemed to him. There had been, it is
true, no wars of any consequence for a fortnight or two, no
Armada threatened, no European paranoiac gazed balefully
across the Channel and regicide was, for that moment,
happily unthought of. Such things were, so long as Victoria
sat on the throne, unthinkable—especially the latter.</p>

<p>But Darwin’s <i>Origin of the Species</i> had been written
some years before, and Karl Marx, who also had something
of a London adventure, had written a book with the stodgy
title <i>Das Kapital</i>, and the Webbs and the Socialists and the
Fabians were quietly preparing their various ideologies.
Things were brewing, even though under the surface, and
no one paid them much heed, least of all the “irresponsibles”
of the Nineties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>These things meant little to Waugh, apparently, and
seemed of no particular consequence. They seemed of even
less consequence to the delicate decadents who were staging
a well publicized literary rebellion of their own. It is not our
intention to go further into the matter nor to list the peculiarities
of these practitioners of pastel prose, nor to relate
the peccadillos of its precocious and precious poets. We content
ourselves with observing that Arthur Machen had little
to do with them, either as individuals or as a group.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>From that day in June 1880 when he first walked in the
Strand with his father, Arthur Machen was fascinated by
London. He did not always love the city, nor was he ever
moved to apostrophise London as young writers have frequently
written of Paris. Anyone who reads <i>Things Near and
Far</i> and <i>Far Off Things</i> will wonder, perhaps, why he returned
to the city time and again, and why he spent so much
of his life there. One is appalled by the dismal history of
those years, by the portrayal of the lonely days spent in damp
basements and musty garrets pouring over old books for the
endless catalogues, and by the lonelier nights in that small
room in the Clarendon Road. The long walks through obscure
quarters of London and the endless explorations of
the suburbs were often the last refuge of desperation and
depression. The encounters and experiences with publishers
and employers were disillusioning enough, the friendlessness
of London was an even greater hardship. You will find all
of this in these two books of sketches and reminiscences—but
they are only incidentally there. For though Machen plainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
states his loneliness and relates the hardships and disillusionments
he endured, he neither emphasizes nor dramatizes
them, and if this seems to us a sad story it is merely that
we are appalled by it, and not because Machen has said, “See
how wretched were my days, how lonely my nights!”</p>

<p>Why then had Machen come to London, again and
again? Why had this shy and retiring scribbler left the orchards
and fields of Gwent, the pleasant rectory in Caerleon,
to live in the great stone city on the Thames? Perhaps it was
because his Welsh blood stirred within him and drove him
to see the White Tower under which, centuries ago, they
had buried the head of Bran, facing to the sea to guard
against invasion. Perhaps it was to see the city that had been
a city even before the legions came, the city fortified by
King Llud, brother to Caesar’s great opponent, Cassibelaunus,
for whom the city was called Caer Llud and later Caer London
and then Londinium and Londres by the foreigners; that
king who was buried at the gates still called Ludgate in his
honor. Or perhaps it was because in London one could walk
into a book shop and ask for Swinburne’s <i>Songs Before Sunrise</i>
as casually as one might walk into the Hanbury Arms in
Caerleon and ask for ale.</p>

<p>For London was first and always a fascinating city to
Machen. It is apparent in every page of his books. This countryman
who could never forget his beloved country, delighted
in the twistings and turnings of the streets and roads that
led through London and eventually emerged from straggling
suburbs into open fields. He notes with pleasure the streets
whose crossings and corners he knew in the ’eighties and
’nineties; he misses them when, thirty years later, they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
been absorbed by some great block of buildings. He remembers
the facades, if such edifices could be dignified by the
term, of the raw, red-brick villas that were then springing up
all about London. He remembers the restaurants and even
the menus, the taverns and the dwellings in the older sections
of London, and the queer individuals and even queerer
incidents he encountered over several decades.</p>

<p>London was for many years (and perhaps it still is) a
city in which anything might happen. Strange encounters,
mysterious strangers—these seemed to abound in the backwaters
and byways of London. The city became to Machen a
sort of Stevensonian Bagdad-on-the-Thames ... and he
found in its streets and lanes, its Inns and Courts, the materials
that went into <i>The Three Impostors</i>, <i>The London Adventure</i>,
<i>A Fragment of Life</i> and many another story.</p>

<p>This was true of Machen, and it was true of other
writers in that decade. Despite the great calm postulated by
Waugh, and in spite of the tremendous vacuum in which
Waugh and other eminent Victorians fondly believed England
and the world existed, there were great things stirring
... and the stirring was mostly centered about London.
Being neither pamphleteers nor journalists, the writers of
that day did not boil and bubble nor forecast trouble as they
might today. To be sure, there was considerable pother about
the New Woman, and the New This and That. But for the
most part they did not try to portray their times. The poets
were quite unaware of the peasants and “bourgeoise” was
merely an epithet to be tossed at an unsympathetic critic on
one of the more conservative journals. Time-conscious they
most certainly were, but they aimed only slightly this side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
eternity. The delicate decadents, the most prolific and the
best publicized group of that time, scarcely bothered to
mention the undercurrents, but their very activity, their prodigious
outpourings, were one of the manifestations of the
stirrings beneath the surface. Then too, there was but one
Shaw for every score of sonnetteers, one Wells for every
dozen dilettante novelists, one Machen for every daring
dramatist of the moment.</p>

<p>The beginnings of social-conscience and the vanguard of
scientific thought were there, obscured for the moment by
the lurid vapors given off by the writers of the purple phrase.
There was, in short, a renascence of wonder, not another revival
of mediaevalism or of neo-Gothicism, but of the wonder
of things that existed behind the veil and seethed beneath
the surface.</p>

<p>This was reflected as much by the lack of reticence in
literature as in the development of new kinds of fiction ...
fiction looking to new horizons. Shaw had already begun to
puncture the balloons of Victorian complacency, Wells was
writing of things that might come, things beyond our time
and beyond our world. Machen began to postulate the existence
of things behind the veil of common appearances. If
Wells looked forward, Machen looked backward. He created
a past as strange and as fearful as the future on some Wellsian
planet. He was interested in the strange sciences of yesterday
as Wells was in the sciences of tomorrow. Machen had read
the treatises on alchemy, occult sciences, hypnotism, spiritualism—and
in all of these he found a grain of truth. Alchemy,
especially, interested him. The search for the basic power
of the universe, the power and the ability to transform metals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
... he could not dismiss completely the possibility. Machen
was no scientist but he had, like Wells, a vast respect for
the potentialities of science, and a keen instinct regarding
probabilities. These men, at least, were not bringing in “the
mean objects of the roadside” and subjecting them to the
cold stare of the microscope.</p>

<p>Certainly we cannot afford to overlook the development
of the detective story by Conan Doyle, whose Sherlock Holmes
was presented not as a member of the existing force of law
and order but as a radical departure from it. Holmes substituted
cerebration for mere procedure. There was then, in
London in the nineties, a small band of adventurers ...
men who ventured to hold new beliefs, who sought for adventure
in social as well as scientific fields, who looked forward
(or backward) for strange worlds to visit. Note how
they title their tales—each chapter, each episode is captioned
in the Stevensonian manner as “The Adventure of the
Speckled Band” or “The Novel of the Black Seal.” They
searched farther afield than Paris for their magic—to the
South Seas, to India, to the very Poles themselves—even to
America.</p>

<p>Whatever was new and strange was usable. About this
time London began to hear tales of the Mormons, and of
the band called the Destroying Angels. Stevenson had them
in mind when he wrote <i>The Dynamiters</i>, Doyle used them
for his <i>Study in Scarlet</i>, and Machen used them as the genesis
of an episode of <i>The Three Impostors</i>.</p>

<p>Wonder was in the air—whether it was expressed by a
minor poet in terms of languishing eroticism or by Sherlock
Holmes in the cataloguing of endless varieties of cigar ash.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Something was stirring and it stirred most vigorously in London.
Behind the facade of London lurked who knew what
marvels or horrors. Behind the faces of Londoners lurked
who knew what good or evil? London was filled with groups
and clubs in search of the unusual. There were suicide clubs,
freak clubs, cults of the horrible, Hellfire clubs and many
others. Man, wondering about his future and his world,
wonders also about himself. The word psychology was used
hardly at all, but men were becoming aware of their minds
and its quirks. Who was there among a group, a club, who
might not have been another Jekyll?</p>

<p>This, then, was London in the 90’s ... a city on the
threshold of still another century. Machen could not have
forgotten that it had been Caer Llud, that the Romans had
been there, and before them the Cymry. The very stones
might burst into bloom, the pavements might ripple and
surge and become as soft under foot as turf, the fogs and
vapors of its chimney pots might become clouds of fragrance
as in an orchard, or of incense as in a great cathedral.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WEAVER OF FANTASY</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>In 1890, although he had begun to write in the modern
manner and had even “fluttered the dovecotes” and startled
the readers of the <i>St. James Gazette</i> with his stories, the
Rabelaisian enthusiasm was still upon Machen. It had, it
is true, abated somewhat of late, but when his translation of
<i>Le Moyen de Parvenir</i> came from the bindery, all brave in
blue and cream and gilt lettering, Machen still felt the spell
strongly enough to set out, finally, for Touraine.</p>

<p>Actually, he had already determined to leave London
before <i>Fantastic Tales</i> came out. He had been living in Soho
Street in two rooms where took place the grim battle of the
fleas. London seemed to pall and to pale after that and he
arranged to take a cottage in the Chiltern Hills. He had
already written some of the tales in his most famous manner;
<i>The Shining Pyramid</i>, <i>The Iron Maid</i> among them; the
idea of <i>The Great God Pan</i> had been born and the country
seemed the place to allow it to mature. There were certain
alterations and repairs to be made on the cottage and he
decided to go to France in the interim. It seemed, one must
suppose, the thing to do—when one has a handsome set of
new volumes one has translated from the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>Much has been said herein, and sometimes somewhat
slightingly, of the amazing effect of La Belle France upon
the literate Anglo-Saxon. It has been intimated that Paris
has always been something of an occupational disease among
writers and minor poets. And here is Machen, off to France,
like any puerile poetaster upon the publication of his first
“slender volume.” To those who feel some word of explanation
is due, some apology for an opinion seemingly shattered,
it will be noted that Machen went to the South of France,
to the countryside—and not to the northern cities and carefully
manicured meadows and pompadoured pleasure-grounds
of the Bois.</p>

<p>Moreover, and this is important, Machen went to a
land that never was. For when he arrived at last in the land
of Rabelais, of Beroalde, of Balzac—he was greatly disappointed.
“The fact was,” he says, “that I had taken for
granted Dore’s wonderful illustrations.” He had supposed
that the enchanted heights, the profound and somber valleys,
the airy abysses of these amazing plates had reprinted,
as faithfully at least as a Chamber of Commerce brochure,
the veritable scenery of Touraine.</p>

<p>The actuality was, alas! pitifully inadequate. Nevertheless
Machen did what all sensible tourists do when the
lands of enchantment fail to live up to the four-color posters—he
visited the local taverns. This has always seemed to
offer consolation and compensation in such cases. At any
rate, the “Faisan d’Or” and “Le Caveau de Rabelais” provided
noteworthy compensation for Dore. It took Machen a
few days to get over his disappointment—but it was not too
long before he could sit at his little table in the courtyard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
at the Faisan and say to himself, “This night I have had as
much good red wine as ever I could drink.” And this was
one of the great moments of his visit to Touraine. It encouraged
him, moreover, and despite his disappointment
over Dore, to return to Touraine every summer for the next
ten years or so.</p>

<p>The landscape of Touraine and the vintages of the
Vouvray pleased Machen, as Paris pleased the poetasters
and absinthe appealed (in theory at least) to the young men
who burned with a “hard gem-like flame” and who wore
their passions and their shoes to tatters in their feverish quest
for <i>la vie</i>. He discovered that there are, here and there, gardens
that address the heart and spirit and not the florist—as
Poe well knew.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1890 Machen returned to London and,
the cottage in the Chilterns still lacking thatch or drains or
some other matters, he took rooms in Guilford Street. Now it
was in Guilford Street, by one account, that he was struck
by the idea for <i>The Great God Pan</i>. It was, he says, on a dark
and foggy afternoon, and with no delay he proceeded to lay
out the story. In another place, however, he relates that it
was in the summer of 1890 that he wrote the first chapter of
<i>The Great God Pan</i>. Whichever it was, the tale was completed
before he went to his cottage in the country. It appeared
in <i>The Whirlwind, Vol. ii</i> for 1890, which also carried
<i>A Wonderful Woman</i>, <i>The Lost Club</i> and an almost
entirely unknown item—<i>An Underground Adventure</i>. Another
story, <i>The Red Hand</i>, is of this period for it appeared
in the Christmas number of <i>Chapman’s Magazine</i> under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
title, <i>The Telling of a Mystery</i>. These matters attended to,
Machen retired to the Chilterns early in 1891.</p>

<p>Of his stay in the country we know remarkably little.
He spent two years there and, when he returned to London
in 1893, he reported that he had “found it nothing.” However
that may be, he did accomplish a certain amount of
work. He wrote a number of his best stories there and completed
two books which he promptly destroyed. The contents
of these books have not been entirely lost however, for much
of what was in them came to light another day. At any rate,
it was in the Chilterns that he wrote <i>The Inmost Light</i>.</p>

<p>This famous story was written to a special commission,
one of the few he received in his life. His stories for the
<i>Globe</i> and <i>St. James Gazette</i> had attracted, as has been noted,
considerable attention, and a Miss Bradden wrote Machen,
asking him to contribute a tale to an annual she was getting
out. <i>The Inmost Light</i> was written for Miss Bradden and
packed off to her from the cottage in the hills. The affrighted
lady returned it after what must have been one of the most
rapid readings on record.</p>

<p>At any rate, in 1894, when “yellow bookery was at its
yellowest,” John Lane of the Bodley Head published these
two tales under the title <i>The Great God Pan</i> as Volume V
of the Keynote Series. There was a title page decoration by
Aubrey Beardsley—this, and the imprint of the Bodley Head,
indicated that the book was, as one might say today, “aimed
at a particular market.” Presumably it hit the mark, for the
tale achieved a fame that has lasted to this day. For this
is the best known of Machen’s stories and—even though
Machen deprecatingly remarks that the book had “made a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
storm in a tiny tot’s tea cup”—there was a considerable
tempest aroused. <i>The Manchester Guardian</i> went on record
as feeling that Machen had “succeeded only in being ridiculous.”
<i>The Lady’s Pictorial</i> found it “gruesome, ghastly and
dull.” The <i>Westminster Gazette</i> decided that it was “an incoherent
nightmare of sex.” Nevertheless, the book was well
received and gained considerably more of a readership for
Machen than had his previously published exercises in the
antique. One wonders what the Boston reviewers thought of
it—for the book was published by Roberts Brothers of Boston
in the same year.</p>

<p>The <i>Manchester Guardian’s</i> reviewer, a staunch fellow
with advanced ideas, had refrained from saying more about
<i>The Great God Pan</i> “for fear of giving such a work advertisement.”
This did not prove to be particularly effective
for the Bodley Head was compelled to bring out a second
edition in 1895. There were other editions: Grant Richards
included the tale in <i>The House of Souls</i> in 1906, and again
in 1913. It was translated into the French in 1901, and reissued
again by Simpkins, Marshall in 1916. Knopf brought
it out in 1924, and the story has been included in numerous
anthologies.</p>

<p>The story of <i>The Great God Pan</i> is simple enough—but
it has the touch of magic. There is a doctor with strange
theories and strange knowledge. He performs an operation
on the brain of a simple country girl—an operation which
permits her to see, for a moment, the great god Pan, with
results that were in accordance with the ancient and traditional
legends concerning what might follow such a vision.</p>

<p>Of course we are all prone, today, to interpret literature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
according to our own lights, and we employ, with facility
if not always felicity—the great gift of hind-sight. We may,
in 1948, judge the tale neither as startling nor as horrifying
as any one of a score or more pulp masterpieces. We may find
Machen’s doctor not too much unlike Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll
or Wells’s Dr. Moreau.</p>

<p>It may even be that <i>The Great God Pan</i> doesn’t stir us
a bit—although that cannot be credited. But in 1894 the
story was an amazing one—and even the comfortably righteous
reviewer on the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> might have pondered,
in the depths of the night, this passage: “Suppose
that an electrician of today were suddenly to perceive that
he and his friends have merely been playing with pebbles
and mistaking them for the foundations of the world; suppose
that such a man saw uppermost space lie open before
the current, and words of man flash forth to the sun and
beyond the sun into the system beyond, and the voices of
articulate speaking men echo in the waste void that bounds
our thought.”</p>

<p>Well, our young Manchester guardian of the public
welfare very probably cried, “Bosh!”—and went resolutely
back to sleep.</p>

<p>Machen, having written it, couldn’t sleep on it. In 1924,
in a book called <i>The London Adventure</i>, Machen quotes the
above passage and says, “It seems to me that the passage
from <i>The Great God Pan</i> is a distinct prophecy of ‘wireless’;
and what would logic have said to it, in 1890, when that
chapter was written?”</p>

<p>And what, for that matter, says logic in 1948—for we
have perceived again, in another way, that we have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
playing with pebbles and mistaking them for the foundations
of the world. For now we think not only of sending
sound to the outermost reaches of space—but man himself,
and at speeds greater than the speed of sound.</p>

<p>There is another thought that might have bothered the
young man of Manchester. A character in the story has
quoted Oswaldus Crollius, “In every grain of wheat there
lies hidden the soul of a star.” Now in 1894 the reviewer,
any reviewer, even the Bostonian, would have muttered something
about “muddled mysticism” and skipped over the sage
utterance of Oswaldus to get along into the “incoherent
nightmare of sex.” What Machen thought of this in ’94 we
do not know—but in 1923 or thereabouts he wrote that he
thought this a wonderful saying; “a declaration, I suppose
that all nature is one, manifested under many forms; and so
far as I can gather, modern science is rapidly coming around
to the view of this obscure speculator of the XVII century;
and, in fact, to the doctrine of the Alchemists.”</p>

<p>Now this was a brave thing to say—even in 1923. The
muddled mysticisms of the ’90’s is today’s theorum—as has
been amply demonstrated. The most fantastic fable or the
most ingenious fiction of one decade may become the newest
discovery in the laboratory of today.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The sojourn in the Chilterns was not as unproductive
as Machen has implied. He had written perhaps more than
we shall ever know—most of his stories lived with him for
years before they were written, and a book or two destroyed
did not cease to exist. Many of his best tales were born and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
others matured in the Chiltern cottage. Still, two years in the
country seemed quite enough.</p>

<p>When Machen returned to London in 1893 he was a
man of property or, if not property in the Galsworthian sense,
of substance in his own. For the various legacies from deceased
Scottish relations that might have meant so much a
few years earlier, had been coming through and accumulating,
and there were now between three and four thousand
pounds in the bank. The days of Clarendon Road, of green
tea and stale bread and tobacco, were over and there were
rooms in Great Russel Street and later in Gray’s Inn. There
was Benedictine in the buffet and a growing circle of friends
and companions.</p>

<p>The possession of several thousand pounds presented
problems—at least the semi-important one of how to invest
it. After looking about for a “good thing,” in a characteristically
casual way, Machen thought of the Brothers—that
courteous pair under whose benevolent auspices he had
translated Casanova in a basement. They had, as Machen
knew, a proposition now and then, and he thought perhaps
they might have suggestions. They had, as it happened, an
excellent one. The <i>Memoirs of Casanova</i>, which he had translated
some years before, was about to be published. A thousand
pounds invested in the project might be a good thing
indeed. Machen had at least that much confidence in the
Brothers, or in his own work—at any rate, he invested. It
was then that one of the Brothers, the more benevolent of
the two no doubt, suggested that he might, since he was
now financially interested, wish to polish up here and there.</p>

<p>Machen was content, however, to limit his contribution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
to the translation and the thousand pounds, and let him
polish who so desired.</p>

<p>The monumental memoirs came out in 1894. Machen’s
translation was the first in the English language and, I believe,
the only complete one to this day. So it is likely to
remain until some unsuspecting scholar may once more be
imposed upon, or some highly solvent professor or richly
subsidized fellow undertakes the task.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson, Fanny to her friends and
Scheherezade to her husband, shared or perhaps inspired
her husband’s view of London as a fabulous Bagdad of the
West, a city of encounters in which all things were probable—even
such things as might rival the tales of the Arabian
Nights Entertainment.</p>

<p>Stevenson, that prince of story tellers, who knew as
well as any man how to invent marvelous tales and to tell
them in a marvelous manner, occupied himself and Fanny
during an illness by creating <i>The Dynamiter</i>. The book was
published in 1885 and came to Machen’s attention at some
time before or during his retreat to the Chilterns.</p>

<p>Machen had been under the Stevensonian influence for
some years. In 1890 he published a story, <i>The Lost Club</i>,
which exhibits marked family resemblance to one of the
early adventures in the <i>New Arabian Nights</i>. At any rate
the <i>Three Impostors</i>, Machen’s next book, is derived from
Stevenson’s <i>Dynamiter</i>, and was written somewhere in this
period when <i>The Great God Pan</i> was creating a stir. The
manuscript was sent, late in the winter of 1894, to Heinemann
who expressed interest, enthusiasm, and then, unaccountably,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
regrets. The reader in the publisher’s office had
been wonderfully encouraging and gloriously flattering. It
was better, said Heinemann excitedly, than Stevenson’s best.
Even a man as modest as Machen marveled at his artistry—and
marveled still more when, early in 1895, the House of
Heinemann returned his manuscript with the usual regrets
and the usual phrase about being unable to use the enclosed
manuscript.</p>

<p>And so, later that year, <i>The Three Impostors</i> was issued
by John Lane, once again in the Keynote Series and once
again with the title page decoration by Beardsley. It failed,
Machen says, to set Fleet Street afire—but it is, of course,
one of his best stories.</p>

<p>Once again, as with so many of Machen’s stories, there
were those who wrote to inquire whether there was not
some foundation of fact, some basis of truth upon which
the tale had been built. So willing are men to suspend their
disbelief! People were forever asking him if his stories
were not based upon some legend current in his part of the
country and, of course, there were those who were willing
to relate incidents and occurrences which closely paralleled
the fantastic fictions of Machen’s inventions.</p>

<p><i>The Three Impostors</i> combined a number of popular
elements. There was, first of all, a portrait of America, or
the American West, as rugged and rough and uncouth as
any Briton could desire. It rivaled and even surpassed, in
some respects, Stevenson’s Western episode in <i>The Dynamiter</i>.
The Stevenson story had also served as a model for
the Mormon episode in Conan Doyle’s <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>.
The resemblances here are even more marked than in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Machen’s tale. As a matter of fact, Christopher Morley has
suggested (in the Saturday Review late in 1947) that Doyle
found the Mormon episode in his occiput following a reading
of <i>The Dynamiter</i> on a rainy evening in 1885. However
this may be, <i>The Three Impostors</i> is a remarkable and absorbing
story, even if it did not do as well as <i>The Great God
Pan</i>—but it has done remarkably well in the fifty-odd years
since it was written.</p>

<p>Back in 1923 Knopf published <i>The Three Impostors</i> in
the famous yellow binding, and again in 1930 in a Borzoi
Pocket Edition. In his introduction to the latter book Machen
wrote:</p>

<p>“In the course of a quarter of a century, I have received
a good many letters of serious enquiry about <i>The Three Impostors</i>.
My correspondents ask me in various terms and turns
of phrase whether there is any foundation for the strange
circumstances and tales narrated in the book.... I began
to get them pretty soon after <i>The Three Impostors</i> was published
in 1895. Then, on the whole, I was rather displeased
than pleased at the question.... I was strongly inclined
to resent the implication that I had embroidered rather than
invented.”</p>

<p>Machen pointed out that the events described in his
book not only did not happen, but could not have happened.
That, at least, was his attitude just after he had written the
book. In later years he changed his mind, for in the Nineteen-twenties
he wrote, “I have had experiences which debar
me from returning the absolute negative of earlier years....
These experiences of mine were trifling enough, but they
suggest the possibility of far greater things and far more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
extraordinary things for those with the necessary qualifications....
I am inclined to urge that the things which I
have known may suggest the probable existence of a world
very far and remote from the world of common experience.</p>

<p>“It may turn out after all that the weavers of fantasy
are the veritable realists.”</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Just why <i>The Three Impostors</i>, certainly not the most
sensational story published in that sensational year, should
have inspired such widespread belief, or at least so much
willing suspension of disbelief, is not too difficult to understand.
The story concerns itself largely with matters having
to do with superstitions and, even if the superstitions involved
were not familiar ones, they had something of the
common quality of all superstitions based on folk-lore.</p>

<p>The story is told through a series of episodes, in the
manner made popular by Stevenson and Doyle. Certain episodes
are represented as being taken from the journals of
some of the characters concerned; others are set forth in
lengthy interviews with still other interested (and interesting)
characters. The story is not overburdened with machinery
and technical tricks, it manages to hang together without
evident strain.</p>

<p>Some of the episodes could stand by themselves as tales
in the Gothic genre—indeed, some of them have so appeared
in anthologies and collections. It is in the telling of these
tales that Machen’s skill as a story teller becomes evident.
There is no one manner, but several, and each is peculiarly
Machen’s own—with clever overtones and undertones of
parody and satire. The satire, be it noted, is directed always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
at the manner and never the matter of the tale.</p>

<p>As for the subject matter, <i>The Three Impostors</i> concerns
the Little People and strange powers that have persisted
until this very day and other speculations. If we accept,
as did William Gregg, F.R.S., who figures in one of the
stories, the theory that much of the folk-lore of the world
is but exaggeration of things that really happened, we are
well on our way to accepting <i>The Three Impostors</i> as wholeheartedly
as did the people who wrote Machen such curious
letters back in 1895. Such is Machen’s magic, moreover, that
we are easily persuaded into accepting almost anything.</p>

<p><i>The Three Impostors</i> also introduces one of the most
engaging figures in English literature. Mr. Dyson is not as
well known, perhaps, as Henry Ryecroft or Stephen Daedalus
or Charteris, but he has, it may be, as fine a future as they.</p>

<p>Mr. Dyson (if he had a first name, I cannot recall ever
having read it) is a “man of letters” who, in pursuit of his
quiet profession (the chase of the phrase, he called it) does
a great deal of wandering about odd quarters of London. He
stumbles into and out of the most amazing adventures, none
of which appreciably affect his composure and seldom indeed
is he startled out of his pompous pedantry.</p>

<p>Dyson’s companion in adventure and the recipient of
his pronouncements is a Mr. Charles Phillips. Phillips is
somewhat younger than Dyson, but they shared a certain
gravity of character and pomposity of manner that made
them mutually acceptable. They met frequently in each other’s
rooms or in the tobacco shop in Queen Street where “their
talk robbed the tobacconist’s profit of half its charm.” Dyson
exalted the claims of pure imagination, while Phillips insisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
that all literature ought to have a scientific basis.</p>

<p>This precious pair, who shared silence as amiably as
they conversed, wander sedately enough through the astonishing
episodes involving the Young Man With Spectacles,
Miss Lally, the sinister Mr. Davis and others. They are encountered
in several other tales of this period. Dyson is
actually an old acquaintance. He first made his bow, and a
very courtly gesture it was, in <i>The Red Hand</i> or <i>The Shining
Pyramid</i>, whichever tale, in truth, came first; but it is in <i>The
Three Impostors</i> that we really came to know him. We shall
meet again.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>This bit of dialogue takes place in one of those chance
encounters with which several of Machen’s tales begins. It
might well have ensued between Machen and some compatriot
of far-off Gwent as they met in a London street
early in that daringly decadent decade.</p>

<p>For Machen, having served an apprenticeship in grangerizing
and cataloguing, having composed calendars and
made translations “on the house” and having written a story
that fluttered the dovecotes and published a book that stirred
up a tempest in a tiny tot’s teacup, was definitely a literary
man—or at least he pursued the practice of letters. He had
cause, in later years, to give the choice more serious thought
than he had in the 90’s. He had cause to reflect upon it, but
never did he regret the choice—if choice it was. For if ever
a man’s destiny lay in the art and the practice of letters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
that man was Machen. And of course he knew this—he
knew it in the lonely room in Clarendon Road and in the
downstairs parlor at Llanddewi. And he knew it years later
when, in computing his earnings for twenty-odd years labor,
he found the sum to be not in excess of £635. And of course
he knew it even when he wondered, as he some times did,
if he had failed in his art.</p>

<p>Machen had in him, besides the seeds of his destiny,
more than a bit of that delightful fellow Dyson whom he
created somewhat to his own image and likeness. Dyson,
you will recall, was “a man of letters, and an unhappy instance
of talents misapplied. With gifts that might have
placed him in the flower of his youth among the most
favored of Bentley’s favorite novelists, he had chosen to
be perverse; he was, it is true, familiar with scholastic logic
but he knew nothing of the logic of life and he flattered
himself with the title of artist, when he was in fact but an
idle and curious spectator of other men’s endeavors. Amongst
many delusions, he cherished one most fondly, that he was
a strenuous worker, and it was with a gesture of supreme
weariness that he would enter his favorite resort, a small
tobacco shop in Great Queen Street, and proclaim to anyone
who cared to listen that he had seen the rising and setting
of two successive suns.”</p>

<p>But this isn’t Machen! Of course it isn’t! Nor am I
suggesting that Dyson is a portrait of the artist as a young
man. But if you will recall for a moment Machen’s obvious
fondness for his creature, Dyson, his almost paternal acceptance
of Dyson’s pomposities and his benevolent air in
setting down Dyson’s latest preposterous formula, you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
realize, I think, that Machen was the model, and that he
rather relished poking a bit of fun at himself, his younger
self at any rate.</p>

<p>Well then, early in the 90’s Machen had his trip abroad
and his cottage in the country and his gradually accumulated
legacies. And now he was, at last, about to have his rooms
in Grays Inn and his summers in the south of France. He
was indeed a man of letters!</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p><i>The Three Impostors</i>, even though it failed to set Fleet
Street afire, did add to Machen’s stature. It gave him something
of a reputation in certain quarters which, if not exactly
fashionable at the moment, were not on the side of the Philistines.
The failure, if it was one, of <i>The Three Impostors</i>
Machen attributes to a contemporary crisis in literary circles.
“There were,” he says mildly, “scandals in ’95—which had
made people impatient with reading matter that was not
obviously and obtrusively ‘healthy.’”</p>

<p>The several tales or episodes that make up <i>The Three
Impostors</i>, while they may be neither obviously “healthy”
nor obtrusively “healthy,” were much less unwholesome
than most of the literature that was then circulating in London.
Based for the most part on early Celtic folk-lore and
legends of the Welsh border, they developed the theme of
primitive races, of “little people” who have, in some out of
the way places, managed to survive to the present day.</p>

<p>The nature of the tales does indeed tend toward the
horrific and even the “unhealthy,” but the manner of their
telling and the presence of the almost “deadpan” Dyson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
in most of these episodes results in a rather curious blend of
pedantry and unpleasantness. Moreover, so faithfully did
Machen follow a Stevensonian pattern that even the Marquis
of Queensbury, had he not been otherwise occupied at the
moment, could have taken no offense. It would seem, then,
that it was this almost sedate treatment that failed to set
the bookstalls ablaze. A less restrained publisher than John
Lane would have had Beardsley do the illustrations for the
book—with quite predictable results. There are those, Grant
Richards and George Bernard Shaw among them, who suggest
that Lane was rather afraid of Beardsley—and not
without reason. For Beardsley was an unpredictable and
vindictive chap. He was once criticized for having drawn a
Pierrot for a cover design of the “Savoy”—it was not the
sort of thing, he was told, that would appeal to the British
public.</p>

<p>A sketch of John Bull was substituted, accepted and
sent out to subscribers. It was then discovered that Beardsley
had taken his revenge by subtly indicating that John Bull
was in a condition in which no Briton would willingly appear
in public. For such sophomoric shenanigans Lane
had given Beardsley the sack. There was never any question
of Beardsley illustrating <i>The Three Impostors</i>, nor
could there be any question of the result. Nevertheless <i>The
Three Impostors</i> rates perhaps third among Machen’s works,
and has been frequently reprinted.</p>

<p>The story did cause publishers, from time to time, to
ask Machen if he had something else in “the manner of
<i>The Three Impostors</i>.” This was not as flattering to the
author’s vanity as might seem. Having gone through the tale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
once Machen had no wish to “re-cook the cabbage which
was already boiled to death.” Nevertheless, one doesn’t
speak thus bluntly to publishers—even when they solicitously
seek manuscripts. There was another and, on the whole,
very attractive proposition. Two gentlemen, obviously with
an eye for such things, proposed a new weekly paper for
which, they further proposed, Mr. Machen and a Mr. Wells
should do a series of stories—and in their familiar manner,
of course. Thus Mr. Machen was to do a series of horror
stories in the manner of <i>The Three Impostors</i> and Mr. Wells
was to do stories in the manner of <i>The Time Machine</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Time Machine</i> had appeared about the same time
as <i>The Great God Pan</i>. While Machen’s story was stirring
up its teacup tempest, a young gentleman named H. G. Wells
had made a very real, and a most deserved sensation with
a book called <i>The Time Machine</i>. Mr. Wells had written
his story at a time when he was living from hand to mouth
as a journalist at lodgings in Kent. And so the new paper,
to be called the <i>Unicorn</i>, was to feature the works of these
two young men who had recently created something new and
exciting and not, as was too often the case in those days,
unfit for general circulation.</p>

<p>Machen admitted that he was cheered and elated at
the prospect ... until he began to re-cook the cabbage.
Possibly Mr. Wells felt the same way, for the <i>Unicorn</i> ceased
to exist before a single one of Machen’s tales (he wrote
four of them) appeared in it, while Mr. Wells contributed
but one story, called <i>The Cone</i>.</p>

<p>Machen realized that the Stevensonian had been done
to a turn—and so he had done with it—there would now be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
something new. He had already written <i>The Shining Pyramid</i>
for <i>The Unknown World</i>, edited by his friend A. E. Waite,
and one or two other tales—but now, once again—and this
time there was no doubt about it—<i>The Great Romance</i>.</p>

<p>Once again there was the question—what was it to be
about? Machen labored mightily over the beginnings of
this new book. He sat at his Japanese bureau in his rooms
at Grays Inn, he roamed the deserted streets and squares of
Bloomsbury and pondered at great length the problem—what
would it be like?</p>

<p>I suppose Dyson would have sympathized deeply with
these soul searchings and solitary soliloquies—for Dyson,
too, had often wondered what his books would be like, and
Dyson had <i>his</i> Japanese bureau. At any rate, and before too
long, Machen had the idea. His book would be “a Robinson
Crusoe of the mind” ... and for such a book, Machen
had traveled well.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Machen had at last decided, and for the second time
in his life, to write the Great Romance. The first time it had
turned out to be <i>The Chronicle of Clemendy</i>, that light-hearted
collection of tales having nothing whatever to do
with the Great Romance he had decided to write, and having
nothing in it of the loneliness of his life in London. This
time it became <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>, and one knows in reading
it that this also is not the Great Romance: for Machen
could not have decided to write <i>The Hill of Dreams</i> any
more than he could have decided to write a “Robinson
Crusoe” of the soul—even though he tells us that this is
precisely what he had decided to do. It is perhaps a coincidence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
and a very fortunate one, that the book did turn out
to be just that.</p>

<p>Machen was, as we have seen, a very careful man with
his models. He could write in the manner of Thomas Browne,
or Robert Herrick, or William Morris, or Robert Stevenson,
and very carefully did he cultivate their manner. When he
had perfected the manner, and made use of it, the design
was there but the substance had altered. However meticulously
he might labor perfecting the model, making no
conscious effort to improve upon it, he could not prevent a
transmutation from taking place. This is apparent even in
<i>The Three Impostors</i> for, even though the pattern is recognizable,
and even though it is studied and carefully contrived,
there are elements, so strong is the triumph of mind over
manner, that make it peculiarly Machen’s own and not
Stevenson’s.</p>

<p>The new book, Machen says, was born in a phrase encountered
in Charles Whibley’s introduction to <i>Tristram
Shandy</i>. Whibley described the work as being “a picaresque
of the mind.” And so Machen said to himself,“I will write
a Robinson Crusoe of the soul.” This was no mere decision;
it was, rather, a demonstration of the fact that there is an
affinity of the mind, some minds, for an idea, some ideas.
<i>The Hill of Dreams</i>, the picaresque of the mind, the Crusoe
of the soul, was at the heart of Machen’s Great Romance.
It responded to a phrase for which it had a natural affinity
and so the Great Romance, <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>, was born.</p>

<p>“It was,” wrote Machen, “to represent loneliness not
of body on a desert island, but loneliness of soul and mind
and spirit in the midst of myriads and myriads of men. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
had some practical experience of this state to help me: not
altogether in vain had I been constrained in Clarendon Road
and to have my habitation in the tents of Notting Hill Gate.
I immediately marked down all these old experiences as a
valuable asset in the undertaking of my task: I knew what
it was to live on a little in a little room, what it meant to
pass day after day, week after week, month after month
through the <i>inextricabilis terror</i> of the London streets, to
tread a grey labyrinth whose path had no issue, no escape,
no end. I had known as a mere lad how terrible it was on
a gloomy winter evening to go out because a little room had
become intolerable, to go out walking through those multitudinous
streets, to see the light of kindly fires leaping on
the walls, to see friendly faces welcoming father, or husband,
or brother, to hear laughter or a song sounding from
within, perhaps to catch half glimpses of the faces of the
lovers as they looked out, happy, into the dark night. All
this had been my daily practice and habit for a long while:
I was qualified then, in a measure, to describe the fate of
a Robinson Crusoe cast on the desert island of the tremendous
and terrible London.”</p>

<p>The writing of this book occupied Machen from the
autumn of 1895 to the spring of 1897. It went very slowly.
For one thing, Machen discovered that the style he had so
carefully cultivated for the telling of the improbable tale
of <i>The Three Impostors</i> had to be just as carefully destroyed
and every mannerism eradicated. He had become fluent in
the Stevensonian vein—now he found himself writing with
uncertainty, nothing flowed easily and naturally. His pen
could not keep pace with his mind and his mind was racing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
rapidly through the garden of Avallaunius in far-off Gwent.
For <i>The Hill of Dreams</i> was to be about, if it was about
anything, a boy’s wanderings and imaginings in a mysterious
place he had found, or dreamed he had found, in the Roman
ruins near Caerleon.</p>

<p>Chapters were written and rewritten, his day’s output
varied from perhaps three lines to three folios. At last the
book was finished in the spring of 1897. He had been at it,
quite steadily, for almost two years, with a summer in Brittany
in 1896, most of which he spent thinking of the book
lying untouched in his room in London. In March 1897
Grant Richards wrote him to ask for his next manuscript.
Mr. Richards, a new publisher, and anxious, no doubt, to
get off on the right foot, wanted something “in the manner
of <i>The Three Impostors</i>.” He got, instead, <i>The Hill of
Dreams</i>. Richards returned the book along with a paternal
letter pointing out to Machen the error of his ways and
urging him not to jeopardize his reputation by publishing
such a book. Several other publishers subsequently did the
same and the book remained for years as it was, still titled
<i>The Garden of Avallaunius</i>, and still not published. And
then in 1907, after ten years, Grant Richards changed his
mind and published <i>The Garden of Avallaunius</i>, but he
insisted also upon changing the title on the plea, perhaps
justified, that no one would properly pronounce “Avallaunius.”
It may be, however, that <i>The Garden of Avallaunius</i>
did appear in print before the Richards edition.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1901 Machen wrote to a friend, a
Miss Brooke-Alder: “A certain story, translated from the
English and called <i>Le Grande Dieu Pan</i>, is now appearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
in a French review. Maeterlinck is extremely interested in
it and has sent a message to the author asking him to forward
any manuscripts in order that they also may be rendered
into French. I am sending a manuscript called <i>The Garden
of Avallaunius</i> which I finished four years ago, and if the
great man chances to like it, I suppose I shall have the
curious fate of finding myself a French rather than an
English author.”</p>

<p>Whether or not this translation and publication ever
took place, I have been unable to discover. However, the
Richards edition of 1907 was the first of almost half a score
that have continued to be largely out of print up until the
present time.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Well, then, the Great Romance was completed in
1897—and they would have none of it. And so it remained
for another ten years, more or less, in one of the spacious
compartments of the Japanese bureau.</p>

<p>Machen was, at this time, living the literary life, not
quite as it was lived by the swish young men who were then
breaking into print and whose names appeared in the more
sensational evening papers and on court writs, but still, it
was the literary life and still—a noble profession.</p>

<p>The Japanese bureau, its cubbyholes and compartments
jammed with notes and notebooks and scraps of paper, had
yielded up many tales and articles that appeared in this or
that journal. Machen had already written <i>The Holy Things</i>,
<i>Psychology</i>, <i>Witchcraft</i>, <i>The Rose Garden</i>, <i>The Ceremony</i>,
<i>Midsummer</i> and many other. He was becoming well known
as the author of a number of rather strange, rather clever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
stories. Sometimes they were called “nasty” or “disagreeable”
stories by outraged critics who were quite likely to
view them with an eye jaundiced by too careful perusal of
<i>The Yellow Book</i>. The Keynote Series sold quite well and
Machen’s <i>The Great God Pan</i> and <i>The Inmost Light</i> in
Volume V, <i>The Three Impostors</i> and <i>The Iron Maid</i> in
Volume XIX had wide circulation. <i>The Memoirs of Casanova</i>,
published in the same year as <i>Pan</i>, though limited to
a thousand copies, brought him some reputation and recognition
on a more scholarly plane. Still, he made no fortune
on these books, then—or ever. And that was beginning to
matter. He was even moved, in 1895, to enter an American
short story competition. His entry, <i>The Red Hand</i>, written
for the competition, won no prize but it did appear in the
Christmas issue of <i>Chapman’s Magazine</i> for that year.</p>

<p>It was a quiet life. He had, in those days, few friends
and few acquaintances. His life was in reading books and
in writing them. That no one seemed to be publishing them
was, for the moment, quite unimportant. He describes his
daily routine in <i>Things Near and Far</i>: “Every morning after
breakfast I read over what I have written the night before,
correcting here and there and everywhere, generally convinced
that the passage which had pleased me so much as
I wrote it was, after all, not magnificent. I took the bulldog
for a walk from twelve to one, and another half hour walk
in the afternoon. Then two cups of tea without milk or sugar
at four, and the rigor of the literary game till seven, and
again after dinner till eleven. It was a life of routine, and
all its adventures, difficulties, defeats and rare triumphs
were those of the written page.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>This was the literary life far removed from the rarified
atmosphere of the Cafe Royale and merry, mad circle of
poets and artists of the Dowson, Beardsley, Conder, Crackenthorpe
set who were usually contemplating Soho or suicide
or both. It was the literary life of a recluse, of a Dyson,
or of the brilliant monologist of <i>Hieroglyphics</i>. In the
course of these long and thoughtful evenings when the pen
scratched and the bulldog dozed and page followed page
into the cubbyholes or into oblivion, Machen formulated
many of the theories of art and literature which were expounded
by the recluse of Barnsbury. Writing of this period
some years later Machen says that literature “is one of the
many ways of escaping from life, to be classified with
Alpine Climbing, Chess, Methylated Spirit and Prussic Acid.”
But this was written in 1915 or thereabouts, in 1897 he was
less inclined to a mellow cynicism. For it was then not only
an escape from life, but a means, perhaps “the only means
of realizing and shewing life, or, at least certain aspects
of life.”</p>

<p>This preoccupation with literature extended even to
his employment, for through 1898 Machen worked on the
staff of “Literature,” a weekly paper published by the Times.
This seems to have been not too happy an association, for
he says he had been harassed and worried for a whole year
in the office of “Literature,” and that he was in high spirits
in May 1899 when he was released from this bondage.</p>

<p>Besides, there were a great many important things to
be done. There was, of course, another Great Romance.
Like its predecessors this one did not quite come off, or it
was never quite finished. What there was of it was eventually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
published as <i>The White People</i>. There were other irons on
the hearth, and one of these had been heated and re-heated
many times before; but it was never quite forged or beaten
into shape.</p>

<p>This is the story we know as <i>A Fragment of Life</i>. It is,
in its present state, a mere fragment of a great work. Machen
had lived with the idea for ten years or more, for the story
was born in another tale published in the Globe or the
Gazette or some other paper in 1890 under the title <i>The
Resurrection of the Dead</i>, which was not quite what Machen
intended when he originally called it <i>Resurrectio Mortuorum</i>.</p>

<p>This story is about a man who one day recovered his
“ancestral consciousness.” The idea had long fascinated
Machen, perhaps because he was forever on the verge of
recovering his own “ancestral consciousness,” or perhaps
because he had never quite lost it. At any rate, it was always
close to him, it greatly influenced his daily life because he
never became used to the contrast between “raw London
suburbs and the old gray houses under the forest near the
river” in Gwent.</p>

<p>This, and <i>The White People</i>, seemed to have been of
the greatest importance to him. Neither was finished in that
century—nor were they ever completely finished. Yet in
this time he wrote and completed one of the best of his
books, and one of the finest books of our time. <i>Hieroglyphics</i>
was finished in 1899 and it joined the fragments and the
beginnings of the Great Romances that had been written
and put aside in that repository of Great Romances—the
Japanese bureau.</p>

<p>Of <i>Hieroglyphics</i> we shall have much to say later, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
it is of greater significance in this twentieth century than
in the nineteenth century in which it was written.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Now we are come to the end of the year 1899—the
turn of the century. This was, as has been previously noted,
an intensely time-conscious era. The birth of the twentieth
century was awaited with perhaps more interest and excitement
than had attended similar events in the past. For
one thing, everyone was conscious of the enlightenment of
their age, progress was almost as much a byword in the
Nineties as it became in the Nineteen-Twenties and the
early Nineteen-Forties. And, of course, there was the minor
satisfaction of knowing that it was quite likely to be the
only turn of the century within the memory of living man.
Prophets of doom had their say and their day along with
those who proclaimed new glory and new heights and new
horizons. It was, to be sure, a well-heralded and eagerly
awaited event. That a mere clock should unemotionally
tick so momentous a second!</p>

<p>The more memorable men of the notorious Nineties
were, for the most part, either dead or dying, visibly decaying
or decently interred. They passed, most of them, mercifully
before the significant second struck.</p>

<p>This was a year of great significance in the life of
Arthur Machen. For in this year “a great sorrow which had
long been threatened fell upon me; I was once more alone.”
And in another place, he writes, “... and then my life
was dashed into fragments. I ceased to write. I travelled.”</p>

<p>Again and again he refers to this event, in his two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
autobiographical books and in several of the forewords
and prefaces he later wrote for re-issues of his earlier books.
Always the references are veiled in mystery or followed by
a recital of strange experiences and a cloud of mysticism
that conceals, as it was intended, the shattering event.</p>

<p>What was this event? There are a few who know, but
they are not likely to reveal what they know. As recently
as 1947, less than a year before he died, Machen wrote in
a letter, “Even now it is painful to recall. I would rather
you did not refer to it.”</p>

<p>Since this is not intended as a biography, nor a Life, we
shall not pursue the matter. There is this much more to
be said, that may give some clue to the events of the year
1900. Machen wrote in <i>Things Near and Far</i>,</p>

<p>“I can set down the facts, or rather such of them as I
remember, but I am quite confident that I am not, in the real
sense of the word, telling the truth; that is, I am not giving
any sense of the very extraordinary atmosphere in which I
lived in the year 1900, of the curious and indescribable impression
which the events of these days made upon me; the
sense that everything had altered, that everything was very
strange, that I lived in daily intercourse with people who
would have been impossible, unimaginable, a year before;
that the figure of the world was changed utterly for me—of
all this I can give no true picture dealing as I am with
what I called facts. I maintained long ago in <i>Hieroglyphics</i>
that facts as facts do not signify anything or communicate
anything; and I am sure that I was right, when I confess
that, as a purveyor of exact information, I can make nothing
of the year 1900. But avoiding the facts, I have got a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
deal nearer the truth in the last Chapter of <i>The Secret Glory</i>,
which describes the doings and feelings of two young people
who are paying their first visit to London. <i>I</i> never bolted
up to town with the house master’s red haired parlour maid;
but truth must be told in figures.”</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>Back in 1880, while his family were making plans for
him, plans involving the Royal College of Surgeons, Machen
used to walk to the Pontypool Road station to pick up the
London papers. On his way back he would rest for awhile,
(it was an eight mile walk) under the hedges and turn to
the theatrical pages which seemed to him by far the most
interesting parts of the paper, and the stage the most fascinating
part of the Fabulous City of the West. And so, in
a sense, he followed the bright lights to London, and then,
having arrived there, set to work in the dark caves (HERE
DWELL PUBLISHERS) of Chandos Street, Leicester Square
and Catharine Street.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest bit of evidence that Machen
ever thought longingly of footlights and grease paint or,
for that matter, that he ever even thought of them at all
after he arrived in London. Yet here in 1901 he dons buskins
or whatever and prepares to tread the boards, and in a travelling
company. His first engagements were with the Benson
Shakesperean Company and with them he travelled the
length and breadth of England for several season. He seems
to have enjoyed it all tremendously, although it does not
seem to have affected or influenced his later work. As a
matter of fact, with the exception of a brief chapter and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
half in one of his autobiographical books, he does not refer
to his career on the stage at any great length. Sufficient unto
the days....</p>

<p>And then one day, perhaps when the trees were beginning
to put forth, Machen resumed the London Adventure.
In 1902, and without fanfare of any sort, Grant Richards
brought out a remarkable book with a strange title. It was
called <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, and it was subtitled <i>A Note Upon
Ecstasy in Literature</i>, by Arthur Machen. The book was
born, as so many books are, while the author was reviewing
books for a weekly journal. It was written in the happy
period following his release from “the detestable office life”
and as a perfectly normal reaction against it, and it remains
to this day one of the best, and the least known and the most
sadly neglected books of English criticism.</p>

<p>A noted publisher once told Machen that <i>Hieroglyphics</i>
had “influenced the whole standpoint of English literary
criticism.” One wishes it had! At any rate, Machen read
proofs of the book while playing in “The Varsity Belle,”
and he read reviews of it while playing in “Paolo and Francesca.”
And then, when <i>Hieroglyphics</i> seemed unlikely to
set Fleet Street afire, or even to start a small blaze in one
of the University debating clubs, Machen began once more
to write and to publish.</p>

<p>His old friend, A. E. Waite, a distinguished writer in
the field of the occult and the mystic, began to publish
Machen’s stories. Waite, who was also manager for Horlick’s
Malted Milk, had managed to persuade the malted milk
magnate to sponsor or subsidize a magazine. This was certainly
the strangest commercial venture on record, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
magazine published material concerning the occult and
mystical topics that appealed to Waite. Horlick was, presumably,
happy to see his name on the cover and on the
masthead of the magazine. It was in this esoteric little journal
that some of Machen’s work first appeared ... <i>The
White People</i>, <i>A Fragment of Life</i> and, at long last, <i>The
Garden of Avallaunius</i>.</p>

<p>Machen remarks, somewhere, that he did not know that
the sale of Malted Milk was unfavorably affected by the
publication of these tales. As a matter of fact, the stories
were quite well received. Such things get around and, in
1906, Grant Richards collected the best of them, plus <i>Pan</i>,
<i>The Inmost Light</i>, <i>The Red Hand</i> and published them in a
book called <i>The House of Souls</i>. Richards had changed his
mind about Machen, but apparently with reservations, for
in 1906 another Machen book, <i>Dr. Stiggins</i>, appeared, but
under the device of a little-known publisher. This book is,
in effect, an amplification of some views set forth in the
Preface to <i>The House of Souls</i>. Mr. Richards wouldn’t
touch this, but he did bring out <i>The Hill of Dreams</i> in the
following year.</p>

<p>And then there was another change in Machen’s life.
He fell into journalism ... something that had once been
devoutly wished for by the dear, dead folk of Caerleon.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>When the Allied armies achieved the break-through at
Saint Lo some few years ago in that war we call Second, our
armored columns fanned out over the Brittany peninsula and
thrust deep into the river valleys of France. Most of us
watched the drive for Paris, shook our heads over that nasty
business at Avranches, and breathed more freely when Paris
fell. From then on it was largely a matter of following, as
closely as the security blackout permitted, Patton’s progress
toward the Rhine and the star-shaped forts at Metz.</p>

<p>Few of us were then aware of the column under Hodges
that began first to probe, then to thrust northward into Belgium.
At the time it was briefly noted that our push to the
Belgian border was even more rapid than the German drive
southward in 1940. And so our entry into and beyond Mons
passed almost unnoticed. Even the Germans were not too
well aware of it, apparently, for it was outside Mons, you
will recall, that German tanks were waved on by American
MPs and obligingly clanked into bivouac areas with the
General Shermans and the half-tracks of the American First
Army.</p>

<p>There were, if I remember correctly, and I am sure that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
I do, one or two references to the Angel of Mons incident of
the last war, but these were merely notes in passing. The
mere mention of Mons meant Machen to me, and I suppose
that, like many another Machenite, I waited with something
like bated breath for a sign of some sort, or a sequel
to the legend that had been born just thirty years ago that
very month of September.</p>

<p>And, I suppose, devout Machenites the world over re-read
in that September of 1944, the invented tale of the
wonderful Welshman, the tale that was at first called simply,
<i>The Bowmen</i> and which came to be called, by popular demand,
<i>The Angels of Mons</i>.</p>

<p>It was one of the strangest stories of that first World
War and a story pure and simple it was. But it so captured
and fired the imagination of all Englishmen, and of the
world, that people were unwilling for it to remain merely
a magical tale by a Welshman writing strange tales in the
city of London. People must have their miracles, and so
Machen’s invention of the Bowmen became one of the hallowed
legends of the war. You may remember the story, for
you must have heard it, in one version or another, even if
you had never even heard of Arthur Machen.</p>

<p><i>It was during the Retreat of the Eighty Thousand</i>, the
tale begins. The English were in danger of annihilation. At
a particularly important point in the line the German guns
had thundered and shrieked all morning. Finally, their numbers
greatly reduced, the English saw a tremendous host
moving against them. German infantry—as far as the eye
could see. Well—the English fought on. One of the riflemen,
who happened to know Latin and other useless things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
recalled a motto he had once seen in a restaurant, <i>Adsit
Anglis Sanctus Georgius</i>, which motto he said, uttered or
shouted. As he did so he felt “something between a shudder
and a shock” and behold! the roar of battle died down to a
gentle murmur and a great voice and a shout louder than
the thunder cried, “Array, Array, Array!” This was followed
by other battlecries in English and in French—cries to Saint
George. And then he saw, “beyond the trench, a long line of
shapes, with a shining about them. They were like men who
drew the bow,” and their arrows flew toward the German
host. Who, as it happened, were stopped in their tracks.</p>

<p>Now this invention served its purpose, no less than any
inspirational tale or legend or truth or half-truth. But it became
a matter of great controversy because, as it happened,
Arthur Machen, when questioned about it, blithely revealed
that there was not an ounce of truth in it. The story was
pure invention, a piece of fiction which was not, he added,
entirely to his satisfaction as a writer.</p>

<p>This discrediting of a miracle soon got abroad, and
there was a great hue and cry and indeed a notable hullabaloo
about the matter. Machen was taken to task ... the
clergy thundered against him and many a pulpit was pounded
by many a pudgy ecclesiastical fist. Gentle ladies began to
produce “evidence” that the event had actually taken place—that
they had had it from a soldier who was there. A great
many witnesses, once or twice removed, were found and
quoted. The controversy grew and with it the legend.</p>

<p>As for Machen, he finally wrote a preface to a new
American edition to <i>The Bowmen</i>, now called <i>The Angels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
of Mons</i>, published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons in 1915. In it he
wrote:</p>

<p>“This was in last August, or to be more precise, in the
last Sunday of last August. There were terrible things to be
read on that hot Sunday morning between meat and mass.
It was in the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i> that I saw the awful account
of the retreat from Mons. I no longer recollect the details,
but I have not forgotten the impression that was then made
in my mind. I seemed to see a furnace of torment and death
and agony and terror seven times heated, and in the midst of
the burning was the British Army. In the midst of the flame,
consumed by it and yet aureoled in it, scattered like ashes
and yet triumphant, martyred and forever glorious. So I saw
our men with a shining about them, so I took these thoughts
with me to church, and, I am sorry to say, was making up a
story in my head while the Deacon was singing the Gospel.”
Well—that is the genesis of <i>The Bowmen</i> or, if you insist,
<i>The Angels of Mons</i>.</p>

<p>It was murmured and hinted and suggested and whispered
in all sorts of quarters, Machen says, that before he
wrote the tale he had “heard something.” The most decorative
of these whisperings was this: “I know for a fact that
the whole thing was given him in typescript by a lady-in-waiting.”
And, presumably, as is the custom with all popular
legends, most everyone had a cousin or a brother-in-law
who had been there. By the time the story had been reprinted
in parish periodicals and spread by word of pulpit, it began
to seem to Machen that he had failed in the art of letters.
There began to be variations on the theme—such as one in
which the German dead were found to be punctured with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
arrow wounds. The occultists next had a go at it, then the
scientists began to talk learnedly of “mass hallucination.”</p>

<p>The legend was then translated into several languages
including, at any rate, the French. The shining figure of St.
George became, variously, St. Michael the Archangel and
St. Joan of Arc. The Germans, for security reasons no doubt,
offered no opinion or explanation of their abrupt halt or of
the tale. However, as Machen observes, “Other versions of
the story appeared in which a cloud interposed between the
attacking Germans and the defending British. In some examples
the cloud served to conceal our men from the advancing
enemy; in others, it disclosed shining shapes which
frightened the horses of the pursuing German cavalry. St.
George, it will be noted, has disappeared—he persisted some
time longer in certain Roman Catholic variants—and there
are no more bowmen, no more arrows. But so far angels are
not mentioned; yet they are ready to appear, and I think I
have detected the machine which brought them into the
story.</p>

<p>“In <i>The Bowmen</i> my imagined soldier saw ‘a long line
of shapes, with a shining about them.’ And Mr. A. P. Sinnett,
writing in the May (1915) issue of <i>The Occult Review</i>,
reporting what he had heard, states that ‘those who could
see said they saw ‘a row of shining beings’ between the
two armies.’ Now I conjecture that the word ‘shining’ is
the link between my tale and the derivative from it. In the
popular view shining and benevolent supernatural beings
are angels and nothing else, and so, I believe, the Bowmen
of my story have become ‘the Angels of Mons.’ In this shape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
they have been received with respect and credence everywhere,
or almost everywhere.”</p>

<p>Pamphlets were published, as is usual in such cases. The
Theosophists published an “answer to Mr. Arthur Machen.”
Another worker in the field collected “numerous Confirmations,
Testimonies, Evidences of the Wounded” and other
materials in an “authentic record” of the event. The furore
died out after the war and the Angels of Mons rested in
legend with only sporadic appearances in the pages of the
Sunday supplements. Within a few years the legend had
graduated to the sphere of science or pseudo-scientific study.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>In 1930 there was published in London a book called
<i>The Mystery and Lore of Apparitions, with Some Account
of Ghosts, Spectres, Phantoms and Boggerts in Early Times</i>
by Harold Shaylor, an investigator in various fields of the
marvelous.</p>

<p>The Frontispiece of this comfortably plump volume is
“from a Drawing by A. Forestier, reproduced by kind permission
from the Illustrated London News.” The sketch
shows eight or nine soldiers in a trench in the foreground
firing at advancing hordes of Germans. To the right and
standing above the parapet of the trench are three gigantic
bowmen, helmeted and with swords at their sides, launching
arrows (visible in the sketch) at the Germans. A fourth bow
and part of an arm are visible at the extreme right. The
Germans are falling in great numbers, at least one is visibly
pierced by an arrow.</p>

<p>Within the book, among the many marvels, we find
this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“Considerable discussion took place in the Press during
the autumn of 1914 and the early part of 1915, with respect
to the phenomena said to have been seen at the Battle of
Mons.</p>

<p>“The publications of these stories brought forth many
others of a similar character, the veracity of which appears
to be unquestioned, and it will be found interesting to compare
them with some of the accounts of phantom armies
told in the preceding pages” (of Mr. Shaylor’s collection).</p>

<p>There follows then a story told by a non-commissioned
officer who was in the retreat from Mons on or about August
28th, 1914. The weather was hot and clear and, between
eight and nine in the evening, this officer was with a group
of others on guard duty. An officer came up and asked if
they had seen anything “startling.” Two men were sent
forward to see if they could discover what the officer meant.
They returned with nothing untoward to report. The officer
then came back and, “taking me and some others a few
yards away, showed us the sky. I could see quite plainly in
mid-air,” says the non-commissioned officer, “a strange light
which seemed to be quite distinctly outlined and was not a
reflection of the moon, nor were there any clouds in the
neighborhood. The light became brighter and I could see
quite distinctly three shapes, one in the center having what
looked like outspread wings, the other two were not so
large, but were quite plainly distinct from the center one.
They appeared to have a long, loose, hanging garment of a
golden tint and they were above the German line facing us.
We stood watching them for about three-quarters of an hour.
All the men with me saw them, and other men came up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
from groups who also told us they had seen the same thing.
I remember the day, because it was a day of terrible anxiety
for us. Later on the Uhlans attacked us and we drove them
back with heavy losses. It was after this engagement, when
we were dog-tired, that the vision appeared to us.”</p>

<p>Thus the story of the non-commissioned officer as told
to Mr. Thompson. Another account of spectral figures is recounted
by a private of the Lancashire Fusiliers. He is supposed
to have given an account of his experience to a Sister
in a hospital. “It’s true, Sister, we all saw it. First there was
a sort of yellow mist like, sort of rising before the Germans
as they came to the top of the hill. Come on like a solid wall
they did. The next minute comes this funny cloud of light
and when it clears off, there’s a tall man with yellow hair in
golden armour, on a white horse, holding up his sword and
his mouth open. The men knew it was St. George. Hadn’t
they seen him with his sword on every ‘quid’ they’d ever
seen?”</p>

<p>Thus the Lancashire Fusilier in Mr. Thompson’s 1930
account. Machen encountered him just as the Putnam edition
was on the presses in 1915. In a Postscript to that edition of
<i>The Bowmen</i>, Machen refers to an article called <i>The Angelic
Leaders</i> written by a Miss Phyllis Campbell. Miss Campbell
relates that she was a nurse in France where there came into
her care a Lancashire Fusilier (the same one presumably,
mentioned by Thompson). He said he had seen St. George
on a white horse, leading the British at Vitry-le-Francaise,
when the Allies turned. His story was corroborated by a
wounded R.F.A. man who was present. The R.F.A. man
said he saw a tall man with yellow hair, in golden armour, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
a white horse, holding his sword up, and his mouth open (as
if, comments Machen, he was saying, “Come on, boys! I’ll
put the kybosh on the devils!”) This figure was bareheaded
and the R.F.A. man and the Fusilier knew that he was St.
George, because he was exactly like the figure of St. George
on the sovereigns. “Hadn’t they seen him with his sword on
every ‘quid’ they’d ever had?”</p>

<p>The difference between having a quid and seeing one
may be significant. At any rate, Machen makes a rather telling
point concerning his Lancashire Fusilier. The soldiers are
said to have known it was St. George by his exact likeness to
the figure on the sovereign. This strikes Machen as being
odd because the apparition is described as being bareheaded
and in armour while the St. George on the sovereign or quid
is just the reverse, since he is quite naked except for a short
cape flying from the shoulders and a helmet. So—the evidence
of the quid they’d either had or seen scarcely presents
sufficient identification of the saint.</p>

<p>A final vision is presented in C. J. Thompson’s book—this
one by a soldier in an artillery battery in a letter dated
June 26th, 1915. He describes a being like an angel with
outstretched wings surrounded by a luminous cloud which
appeared between the advancing Germans and the British.
The artillery man further states, “with regard to the stories
which you have heard about angels and spirits, they may be
right but of course you must remember that trench work is
mind-straining as well as nerve-racking and that may account
for a lot of these stories.”</p>

<p>And indeed, Mr. Thompson ascribes most of these visitations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
visions and miracles to nerve strain or mass
hallucination.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the legend had, by this time, divorced
itself completely from its creator. Mr. Thompson
makes no mention of Arthur Machen, either as the reporter
or creator of this astonishing event. Nor do Thompson’s
<i>Acknowledgments</i> or <i>Index</i> contain any mention of Machen,
Arthur; or of his published works. Of course the tale of <i>The
Bowmen</i> was first published in a newspaper, the London
<i>Evening News</i> for September 29, 1914, for which paper
Machen was then a reporter. Mr. Machen may have been
included in Mr. Thompson’s inclusive word “Press.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>However, the curious turnings and twistings of legend
are not yet finished. The miracles of 1915 became the mass
hallucinations of 1930, and the creator of the slight story of
<i>The Bowmen</i> had been quite forgotten in the furore attending
each of them. But by far the most curious circumstance
in the whole curious affair is contained in the most recent, to
my knowledge, mention of the Mons legend. It occurs in an
article by Meyer Berger, entitled <i>Legends of the War</i>, published
in <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> in January, 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. Berger is an extremely competent correspondent
for the <i>New York Times</i>. As a matter of fact, it was out of
respect for Mr. Berger’s worth as a correspondent that I
saved from salvage the magazine in which his article appeared.
Early in the spring of 1944 I was cleaning out the
winter’s accumulation of magazines and newspapers and
readying them for the next paper pick-up. The baroque<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
<i>Bazaar</i> is not, usually, to my taste, but seeing Berger’s name
over an article I placed the magazine to one side and took
it up to read some nights later.</p>

<p>The article concerns <i>legends</i> of the war. Mr. Berger
remarks, sensibly, that war nurtures in the soldier some
dormant sense that opens the door to superstition, to mysticism,
and to visions of the supernatural. He then outlines
the various legends of the White Lady on various fronts, the
Christ in Flanders legend and, of course, the Angel of Mons.
Mr. Berger uses the singular, and so one supposes, there is an
Angel of Mons legend as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Berger outlines the legend briefly, explaining that
there was no earthly reason for the Jerries to have stopped
the pursuit, but stop they did—and the wherefore of this
astonishing halt forms the basis for the story.</p>

<p>“Arthur Machen said later,” continues the Berger article,
“that he conceived the legend of the Angel of Mons as
he daydreamed in church over the news of the German’s
miraculous halt.” This is not quite what Machen said, of
course. Machen explained that he conceived the story of the
Bowmen as he brooded in church over the news of the British
<i>retreat</i>. Berger goes on to relate that when Machen’s story
appeared in the London <i>Evening News</i> as fiction it was, to
his (Machen’s) astonishment, taken up and spread all over
the world as something that actually happened. “There is
no reason,” remarks Berger, “to question his explanation.”</p>

<p>On the other hand Berger spoke in France with Tommies
who swore that, Machen or no Machen, they saw the
Angel at Mons, though not as he described it in his piece.
“The Machen story said that when the British were hardest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
pressed at Mons, there appeared in the heavens, above the
battlefield, an unusual cloud formation. This changed into a
giant likeness of St. George, flanked by rows of medieval
English bowmen whose flights of arrows killed virtually all
the German horde. When the bodies were examined there
was no sign of a wound.”</p>

<p>Whatever this may be, it is <i>not</i> the Machen story.
Machen has no cloud, no giant St. George ... only “a
long line of shapes with a shining about them.” Mr. Berger
also talked with a Sergeant Coombs of the King’s Royal
Rifles at an English base hospital in Trouville. Coombs swore
he had seen the Angel of Mons and Berger had reason to
believe him, “if only because he wore the Mons Star.”
Coombs describes “a kind of triple cloud” ... a large
center cloud with two clouds at either side. They had no
particular shape at first but they gradually became a great
angel ... “the two smaller clouds were enormous wings,
and the angel spread its wings as if it were signalling the
jerries to stop where they were.”</p>

<p>This seraphic semaphore is a refinement that had not
previously appeared in any of the many versions of the
legend. One of the legend’s variations, writes Berger, “has a
faintly humorous side.” It appeared in the <i>North American
Review</i> in August, 1915.</p>

<p>“It told of a soldier, hard-pressed with the rest at Mons
and ready to drop, who found himself murmuring, ‘Adest
Anglis Sanctus Georgius.’ He knew no Latin and he didn’t
know what moved him to the utterance. Even as it came to
his lips, he recalled that he had seen it lettered on a plate
in a vegetarian restaurant in London, before he was called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
up to service. It means, roughly, ‘May St. George be a present
help to England.’ Something like an electric shock convulsed
the soldier and his shock-packed ears dimly heard men
around him shouting, ‘St. George for Merrie England.’ From
that point, the story followed the Machen pattern—archers
appeared in the sky and the Germans dropped by thousands.”</p>

<p>Now this version, with the “faintly humorous side,”
which appeared according to Mr. Berger in the <i>North American
Review</i> in August, 1915, <i>is</i> the Machen story. Whether
or not the North American Review version was written by
Machen I have been unable to discover. There are differences,
of course, even in the very condensed portion offered by
Berger. The <i>North American’s</i> soldier knew no Latin ...
he merely recited, incorrectly at that, and at a very propitious
moment, a motto he had seen in a vegetarian restaurant.
Machen’s soldier, although he had apparently patronized
that very same vegetarian restaurant, did know Latin “and
other useless things.”</p>

<p>And so the legend of the legend of the Angel or Angels
of Mons continues to grow out of Arthur Machen’s tale of
<i>The Bowmen</i>.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>In 1915, possibly because he was then writing <i>Far Off
Things</i> and was in a mood reminiscent, Arthur Machen declared
that he had failed in the art of literature. Most good
writers have felt, at one time or another, a similar sense of
failure—or at least of mild frustration. Presumably they have
a particular instance in mind, certainly Machen had his. It
was simply because his tale of the Bowmen had been accepted
as truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Now it may seem to many a triumph of art that one’s
work is held to be so life-like and so real that it is generally
accepted as the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth. Our realists, for example, are said to feel that way.
They consider the verdict of veracity the highest critical success.
They have mirrored life and that, so help them, was
what they had set out to do!</p>

<p>Machen felt differently about it. His invention, his
creation, was not only accepted as being true, but his inventiveness
and creativeness were denied him. His magic had
been judged mere journalism and that, to Machen, or to any
other creative artist, meant failure. However this may be,
Machen did not fail in his other legends of the war. Possibly
because he called some of them legends—perhaps because
the public felt their “willing suspension of disbelief”
already supported too great a load—at any rate Machen’s
further inventions were permitted to remain inventions and
he was accorded a considerable, if not fanatical, amount of
praise.</p>

<p>These other tales, <i>The Soldier’s Rest</i>, <i>The Monstrance</i>,
<i>The Dazzling Light</i>, had in them the very elements that should
have appealed to those who make legends of inventions.
They offered much in the way of tradition blended with
mysticism, a mixture that should have drawn credence from
a much less tradition-loving people than the British. Perhaps
there was too much mysticism in these tales—anything
less subtle than a warrior saint might not appeal to the
Church Militant.</p>

<p>But surely <i>Drake’s Drum</i>, or the tale called <i>Munitions
of War</i> had the stuff of legend in them, and tradition too.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Layed on, as a matter of fact, with the trowel. <i>Drake’s Drum</i>
should have become one of the glorious legends of the sea-girt
Britons, the race of mariners. This is the tale that relates
the events that took place off Scapa Flow, when the
British Navy awaited the German High Fleet in November,
1918 to accept their surrender. There were rumours that
the Germans might possibly fight and the crews of the British
ships stood at “Battle Stations.” Then, as the first German
ship appeared through the mist, a drum began to beat
in the “Royal Oak.” And it beat and it rolled from then until
the entire German Fleet was encircled and helpless. Of course
the unauthorized drumming was investigated, but with all
hands at Battle Stations, and especially upon such a momentous
occasion, it was hardly possible, and highly improper,
that there might be anyone aboard ship with the time and
the inclination to beat a drum. However, neither drum nor
drummer were located and there was no choice but to believe
that what everyone had been hearing was Drake’s
Drum—“the audible manifestation of the spirit of the Great
Sea Captain, present at this hour of tremendous victory of
Britain on the Sea.”</p>

<p>Now this is certainly a tale that should have appealed
to the Britons, as indeed it did, but they refused to raise it to
the status of a legend. Then too, the story appeared in 1919,
by which time England had less urgent need of legends. In
any case, the perfidious Teutons had by that time scuttled
their ships at Scapa Flow.</p>

<p><i>Munitions of War</i>, a story published in 1915, also has
the stuff of legend, but somehow it never caught, never quite
made the grade. Oh, it was successful enough as a story, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
it never became a legend. Which, on the whole, pleased its
creator. It tells of a traveller who went to a seaport in the
West of England and how he was awakened in the night to
hear vast oaths and burly voices heaving and ho-ing as they
loaded ships. The language used by these stevedores had an
other-century quality and the watcher in the night could only
conclude that these men had loaded Nelson’s ships before
Trafalgar. Had this story been written in 1942 or 1943 instead
of 1915 it might have been printed in the “Welders
and Steam-Fitters Gazette,” or some other house organ, and
it may even have been legendized by England’s defense workers
and winners of the coveted “E” award—or its British
equivalent.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>One of the longest, and by far the best, of Machen’s
stories of the war period is one that made no appeal whatever
to the legend-loving instincts of a people at war but
which contained, as we may see in this post-war year of ’48,
something of the nature of prophecy.</p>

<p><i>The Terror</i> was first published in 1917. It was obviously
inspired by the reception accorded the tale of the Bowmen
combined with more of Machen’s creative magic. In
the opening chapter Machen refers to the rumours and legends
current in the early years of the war—the Bowmen, and
the Russians who traveled through Britain by night on their
way to some great push or other. These absurdities, Machen
points out, depended upon the newspaper for their dissemination.
The events described in <i>The Terror</i> had been held
in strictest secrecy and no word had been given to the Press.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
For reasons of security all events connected with the Terror
had been hushed up.</p>

<p>However, continued Machen, in a “now-it-can-be-told
manner,” these were the reasons why “almost two years of
war had been completed before the motionless English line
began to stir.” The story of the Terror is, then, purported
to be the secret of the long inactivity of the British Army.</p>

<p>Things were happening all over England ... very
strange things. An airman had been killed under mysterious
circumstances. The circumstances appeared to have been obvious
enough—he seemed to have been attacked by a flock
of birds, a rather mysterious matter in itself. There were
other happenings here and there, and rumors of many more.
After a few strange events had been reported in local papers
there were no further accounts, and sometimes there was no
local paper thereafter. Few people would have connected
these events in any case. An airman is killed. A child chases
a butterfly and is seen alive no more. There are strange
stories about munitions works and fiery clouds and bees and
horses and dogs. But none of these may be written up in
the papers.</p>

<p>Well, at long last and with Machen’s usual circumambience
and magic the story reveals that the mysterious deaths
and strange events are being caused by animals—by cows and
sheep and dogs and horses and bees and birds and moths.
The explanation? Machen writes—</p>

<p>“... The source of the great revolt of the beasts is to
be sought in a much subtler region of inquiry. I believe that
the subjects revolted because the king abdicated. Man has
dominated beasts throughout the ages, the spiritual has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
reigned over the rational through the peculiar quality and
grace of spirituality that men possess, that makes a man to
be that which he is. And while he maintained this power and
grace, I think it is pretty clear that between him and the animals
there was a certain treaty and alliance. There was
supremacy on the one hand, and submission on the other....
‘Spiritual’ signifies the royal prerogative of man, differentiating
him from the beast. For long ages he had been putting
off this royal robe ... he had declared, again and again,
that he is not spiritual, but rational, that is, the equal of the
beasts over whom he was once sovereign. He has vowed
that he is not Orpheus but Caliban. But the beasts ... perceived
that the throne was vacant—not even friendship was
possible between them and the self-deposed monarch. If he
were not king he was a sham, an impostor, a thing to be
destroyed.”</p>

<p>But before these mysteries are resolved there is much
talk of German spies, of mysterious rays, of all sorts of
things that attempt to link the chain of horrors with the
Germans. And in the course of these attempts to implicate
the Germans in the Terror, Machen creates several hypotheses
which seemed the very stuff of fiction in 1917—but which in
our time must seem like prophecy.</p>

<p>It was in 1944 that the Viking Press issued a volume of
its Portable Library devoted to <i>Six Novels of the Supernatural</i>.
Machen’s tale of <i>The Terror</i> was one of the six.
Thus it happens that I re-read <i>The Terror</i> at about the time
our forces were capturing the platforms from which the
robot bombs were launched at London. Now <i>The Terror</i>
has always pleased me as a tale, a diversion and, as with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
most of Machen’s magic, something to think about when
the world is quiet and mysterious—say a midnight in October,
or three o’clock of an August afternoon. Nothing is
inconceivable at such times, I think, and anything can happen—or
seem to happen. A long, long look at a tree or a
hedge or a hillside might give rise to disturbing thoughts—and
one often finds oneself looking hastily away before
something actually <i>does</i> happen.</p>

<p>But to return to <i>The Terror</i>. I had read it several times
before and I thought I knew it quite well. But reading it in
1944 it seemed quite new. I had not remembered some things,
perhaps because they seemed only incidental to the plot.
They were the sort of thing one skipped over rapidly to see
what would happen next, or when and where the Terror
would strike again.</p>

<p>Well along into the story a Mr. Merrit, one of Machen’s
more talkative characters, is explaining to a group of friends
that “the Terror” is all part of a German plot, that there
are, indeed, Germans established in England who are doing
these things. And this, according to Merrit, is how it was
done:</p>

<p>“The scheme had been prepared years before, some
thought soon after the Franco-Prussian War. Moltke had
seen that the invasion of England presented very great difficulties.
The matter was constantly in discussion in the inner
military and high political circles, and the general trend of
opinion in these quarters was that at the best, the invasion
of England would involve Germany in the gravest difficulties,
and leave France in a position of the <i>tertius gaudens</i>.
This was the state of affairs when a very high Prussian personage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
was approached by the Swedish professor, Huvelius.”</p>

<p>Professor Huvelius, according to Merrit (or Machen)
was an extraordinary man. He was personally an amiable
individual who gave every penny he owned to the poor, who
dissipated his salary on charity and kindness. He starved
himself in order to help the needy. And he wrote a book
called <i>De Facinore Humane</i>, which book proved the infinite
corruption of the human race.</p>

<p>The amiable Professor preached a cynical philosophy,
the main tenets of which have a familiar sound. He held
that human misery was due, by and large, to the mistaken
notion that man was naturally well-disposed and kindly.
Murderers, thieves and other abominable creatures are
created by the false pretense and foolish credence of human
virtue. And he goes on to say that kings and the rulers of
people could decrease the sum of human misery to a vast
extent by acting on the doctrine of human wickedness.</p>

<p>“War,” says the mild Professor, “which is one of the
worst of evils, will always continue to exist. But a wise
king will desire a brief rather than a lengthy war, a short
evil rather than a long evil. And this not from the benignity
of his heart towards his enemies, for we have seen that the
human heart is naturally malignant, but because he desires
to conquer, and to conquer easily, without a great expenditure
of men or of treasure, knowing that if he can accomplish
this feat his people will love him and his crown will
be secure. So he will wage brief victorious wars, and not
only spare his own nation, but the nation of the enemy, since
in a short war the loss is less on both sides than in a long
war. And so from evil will come good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>This philosophy sounds more and more familiar as
Merrit goes on to expound what he knows of the works of
“Professor Huvelius.” The wise ruler will assume that the
enemy is infinitely corruptible and infinitely stupid, since all
men are so. The ruler then makes friends in the very council
of his enemy and among the people of his enemy, bribing
the wealthy and offering opportunity for still greater wealth,
and winning the poor by swelling words. “For,” says the
Professor, “it is the wealthy who are greedy of wealth, while
the people can be gained by talking to them of liberty, their
unknown god.”</p>

<p>At any rate, this Huvelius sold his plan to the Germans.
His philosophy too, apparently, and presumably he donated
the moneys thus obtained to his favorite charity. The Germans
accordingly proceeded to buy lands in certain suitable
places in England, secret excavations were made and in a
short time there was a subterranean Germany in the heart
of England. The Germans, having made themselves as
secure as Crusoes, waited for “the Day.”</p>

<p>This, then, was the plot outlined by Machen as he carefully
prepared the background for his story. It seemed not
too incredible in 1915 as he worked on the book, for there
were rumors even then of emplacements ready for guns
discovered by British troops in Belgium and in France, and
certain caves along the Aisne seemed to have been made
ready for cannon.</p>

<p>Now all this imagining in 1915 and 1917 comes pretty
close to the events of 1940. Whether the Germans had read
Huvelius or Machen in the years of the Long Armistice, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
confined their reading to <i>Mein Kampf</i>, which seems the
more likely, they had certainly covered the ground from
Eben Emael to Quisling.</p>

<p>At any rate, <i>The Terror</i> is first rate reading at any time,
and certainly a Machen “must.” It is too lengthy to be
included in the usual bibliography—but it is readily available
in Viking’s “Six Novels of the Supernatural.”</p>

<p>It would be unflattering indeed to imply that Arthur
Machen’s books were quickly discarded by their owners, or
that they had ever crowded, in any considerable numbers,
the shelves of the second-hand book shops. Nevertheless it
is a fact that for some years, especially in the late Twenties
and early Thirties, the shelves, counters and sidewalk tables
of Fourth Avenue were high-lighted for browsers by the
bindings that blazed forth the magic of Machen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus2">

<p class="caption">SOME MACHEN ITEMS: Showing one of the famous
Knopf “Yellow Books,” title pages of Knopf edition and Pocket Book,
Putnam’s 1915 edition of “The Bowmen” and several rare items.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Alfred Knopf who undertook in the Twenties to
introduce, or to reintroduce, Arthur Machen to American
readers elected, perhaps for obvious reasons, to issue the
odd-sized books in a bright yellow binding. For this, as well
as for his work in bringing Machen across the Atlantic, Mr.
Knopf is to be thanked; but whoever designed the books,
having specified an unmistakable color for the cloth binding,
decided also upon a dark blue paper label with gold lettering—a
combination that became, in a reasonably short
time, completely indecipherable. There was, however, no
mistaking a Machen—even when it turned up in the darkest
corner of the most unassuming hole-in-the-wall in Fourth
Avenue, Twelfth Street or lower Lexington Avenue. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
adept Arthurian merely looked for the unmistakable yellow
binding with its dark and indecipherable patch. It must be
admitted that the production manager or book designer for
Knopf planned better than he knew, for it seemed that time
could not dull, nor dirt disguise, nor grime diminish the
yellow of those bindings. The experienced browser could
spot one at thirty feet in the dimmest corner of the dingiest
shop, sandwiched though it might be between <i>V. V.’s Eyes</i>
and <i>The Conquest of Fear</i> or buried under a pile of Edgar
Rice Burroughs’ Martian romances. A recent convert might,
for a time, respond to the lure of the yellow only to find, on
closer inspection, something about a eunuch by a man named
Pettit, or an early Ben Hecht, or some other ordinary book
bound in yellow; but in time he learned to distinguish that
one especial hue. He came to know it, however faded, for
it seemed to fade predictably.</p>

<p>Thus the yellow books issued by Knopf became the
most eagerly sought-after books along Fourth Avenue. It
was not too long of course, before they became scarce. Soon
they were taken from tables and stacked reverently on
shelves, and before very long they were behind glass doors
or in the shelves behind the proprietor’s desk, or even in
that holy of holies—the back room.</p>

<p>Today they have disappeared from Fourth Avenue.
You may find, now and then, one of the Martin Secker
editions, or perhaps one of the deluxe editions of the Heptameron—or
even a set, fabulously priced, of the Caerleon
edition. For the most part, however, the book shops are
Machen-less, a condition that might be remedied, and profitably,
by some enterprising publisher, or even by Mr. Knopf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>The House of Knopf, however, seems remarkably disinterested
in its valuable property, and a valuable property
it is, for not only did the series include almost all of the
best of Machen, but almost every volume contained a preface
or a foreword written especially for these editions by Mr.
Machen. These comparatively recent Machen items are worth
a volume of their own, a proposition warmly advanced by
Mr. Joseph Vodrey but received coolly enough, thus far at
least, by Mr. Knopf.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Machen had first appeared in print in America in 1894
when Roberts of Boston published <i>The Great God Pan</i>.
There were several other Machen items published in this
country prior to the Twenties. Dana Estes brought out <i>The
Hill of Dreams</i> and <i>The House of Souls</i> not long after the
Richards editions and in similar format. Putnam published
<i>The Bowmen</i> in 1915 while the controversy over the legend
was still raging. There were a few others, but the Machen
boom was still to come. Mr. Cabell’s tribute to Machen in
<i>Beyond Life</i>, published a few years later, undoubtedly did
much to create a body of readers eager for Machen.</p>

<p>Just how and when Mr. Alfred Knopf became interested
in Machen as a literary property I do not know, one
does not with impunity ask publishers why they seek out
certain authors. Certainly Mr. Knopf was of the opinion
that the Twenties was ripe for Machen—anyone who remembers
that era would, even today, vindicate Mr. Knopf’s
judgment. Yet somehow, Machen did not catch on as well
as might have been expected. Or perhaps he did—for the
Twenties. For this was certainly a prolific period, genius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
was hailed weekly and books sold by the thousands. Perhaps
Machen’s books did sell quite well by the standards of
the Twenties. The Knopf printings seem to have been exhausted
within a remarkably short time and very rapidly
disappeared from book stores until their reappearance on
second-hand stalls in the Thirties. Arthur Machen is not
remembered too well as one who was popular in the Twenties,
but then all too few of the writers of the Twenties are
remembered at all.</p>

<p>Who were they? Critics and commentators of the times
hailed book after book, they acclaimed name after name—but
most of those names are seldom mentioned in the current
revival of interest in the Twenties. The “best seller”
lists of the day hardly indicate that John Dos Passos, Cabell,
Van Vechten, etc., etc., were what all America was reading.
Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis and one or two others are
notable exceptions, but the real best-sellers of the time would
sound unfamiliar even to students of that era. Most people
were reading <i>The Sheik</i>, <i>If Winter Comes</i>, <i>Black Oxen</i>,
<i>The Green Hat</i> and <i>So Big</i>. Zane Grey and Ibanez were
more widely read than Sinclair Lewis, even though <i>Main
Street</i> had created a stir. There were outlines of history and
of philosophy and even the “art” of thinking was popularized.
There were books about China and Africa and
India—and some of them even became the centers of controversy.
Storms raged over books whose very titles are
unremembered today, while the books we now consider
“typical” of the Twenties sold slowly—and in small editions.
One discovers that Eleanor Wylie, Ellen Glasgow,
Floyd Dell, E. E. Cummings and most of the others who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
even though they were hailed on alternate Tuesdays and
Sundays as “new stars of great magnitude in the literary
firmament,” were not too widely read, despite the assistance
some of them received from the newly formed book clubs.
Nor are they recalled nowadays with even fond recollection
by very many. It is, therefore, not surprising that Arthur
Machen remains one of the more obscure writers of the
American Twenties, as well as of the English Nineties.</p>

<p>Interest in Arthur Machen was stirring even before the
Twenties, but it was principally among writers and literary
people. James Branch Cabell, whose <i>Beyond Life</i> was first
published in 1919, was perhaps the first to mention in print
the name of Arthur Machen and something of his work.
In one of his lengthy monologues, speaking through the
amiable and erudite Charteris, he says, “I wonder if you are
familiar with that uncanny genius whom the London directory
prosaically lists as Arthur Machen? If so, you may
remember that in his maddening volume <i>Hieroglyphics</i> Mr.
Machen circumvolantly approaches to the doctrine I have
just voiced—that all enduring art must be an allegory. No
doubt, he does not word this axiom quite explicitly: but
then Mr. Machen very rarely expresses outright that which
his wizardry suggests.”</p>

<p>It was about this time that Starrett discovered Arthur
Machen, perhaps through Cabell whose work he was
among the first to praise. Starrett it was, along with Paul
Jordan-Smith, who tried to popularize Arthur Machen even
before the famous Knopf “yellow books” were issued. A
small group gathered about Starrett and Jordan-Smith to
try to prove to publishers that Machen <i>was</i> important and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
that his books <i>were</i> being collected. In 1919 Smith wrote
to several publishers about Machen, but they were not interested.
The group then made every effort to have Machen’s
first editions rise from nothing to ridiculous heights.</p>

<p>They succeeded all too well in this, for as Jordan-Smith
says, “There were only a few of us then, but we
seemed to be many, for we were bidding against one another
in a hundred shops all over Britain. We did not expect
the publishers to enter the rare book field. We merely wanted
them to publish new books and reprint old ones by Machen.
Instead they made limited editions and spoiled the whole
business.”</p>

<p>Mr. Starrett, who is one of the most enthusiastic of
Machen’s admirers, finally did something about it on his
own. In 1923 he published, with his friend Covici, a collection
of Arthur Machen’s stories and essays under the
title <i>The Shining Pyramid</i>. This book was published in an
edition limited to 875 copies. It contained, besides the title
story, a number of pieces that had not previously been published
in book form, and many of which have not since
been reprinted. This is one of the better collections of
Machen material which deserves reprinting today. In the
following year Starrett published another collection under
the title <i>The Glorious Mystery</i>. This, too, contained much
new material and much that has not appeared elsewhere.</p>

<p>At the same time, perhaps even before Starrett was
preparing to publish his collections, Alfred Knopf became
interested in Arthur Machen and wrote him with an offer
to publish anything of his he could find. Apparently Knopf’s
negotiations coincided, in point of time at any rate, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Starrett’s plans. In 1925 Machen published in London a
collection called <i>The Shining Pyramid</i>. The book was published
simultaneously in New York by Alfred Knopf. It
contained an introduction in which Machen wrote: “<i>The
Shining Pyramid</i> is the result of a collaboration. Two years
ago an American man of letters, full of industry, rummaged
in old papers, magazines and manuscripts owing their origin
to me, and produced as a result of his labors a volume
published at Chicago, called <i>The Shining Pyramid</i>. The
American gentleman, I may say, did not disturb my peace
by consulting me as to the content of the book in question.
Then, in 1924, pleased, I suppose, with the results of his
toils, he rummaged a little more, and, using the same
methods, produced a second volume of scraps and odds
and ends from my workshop. This book he entitled <i>The
Glorious Mystery</i>.”</p>

<p>Knopf had, by this time, published quite a number of
Machen’s earlier books. Three books were published in
1922, four in 1923, four in 1924 and four in 1925, of
which <i>The Shining Pyramid</i>, with its introduction, was
one. The “yellow books” were finding their way to the
more discriminating and discerning readers in America.</p>

<p>The publication of two books bearing the same title,
one issuing from Chicago, the other from London and New
York, stirred up a controversy. How far this went and how
it terminated is not public knowledge. In April of 1924
Knopf circulated to the trade a letter on the Alfred A.
Knopf-Arthur Machen versus Covici-McGee-Vincent Starrett
controversy. According to Paul Jordan-Smith the whole
thing was the result of a misunderstanding. “This much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
I know. Starrett had been given the manuscripts of two or
more books to get published as he could, at a time when
publishers were shy of Machen. Years ago I saw them and
at least one letter advising Starrett to do what he thought
best about publishing them. Then Knopf came along with
an offer to publish anything of Machen’s he could find.
How Machen answered this I do not know, but he did give
the rights to Knopf. But in the meantime Starrett had made
arrangements with Covici, his Chicago friend and former
book seller. It was unfortunate, and I fancy Machen’s poverty
and Knopf’s established position made Machen want
to transfer to him. Both were rather bitter. But as I recall
the matter over the years I was impressed with the fact that
both had acted in good faith until Knopf’s money made
Machen jump. I think he would not have embarrassed
Starrett if he had not been utterly lacking in money and
had not had two small children to feed.”</p>

<p>Apparently the whole matter was settled amiably, for
one of the subsequent Knopf editions is dedicated to Vincent
Starrett. The “controversy,” such as it was, is not a
matter to be revived, nor is it my intention to do so.
Machen, and all who know him, owe too much to both
Mr. Knopf and Mr. Starrett.</p>

<p>Another early worker in the Machen field was Carl
Van Vechten. Besides making Machen a sort of intellectual
“prop” for his precious <i>Peter Whiffle</i>, Mr. Van Vechten
wrote some of the earliest appreciations of Machen. I
must confess that there was a time when V. V.’s eyes
seemed to me a trifle jaundiced in his estimate of Machen,
and there was a time when I rather hotly resented the implications<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
of the title <i>Excavations</i>. But time mellows most
of us, Machenites especially, and I have come to regard and
to welcome Mr. Van Vechten as a trail-blazer. It is true
that I cannot accept some of his estimates of Machen, and
I dare say I have often thought that he liked Arthur Machen
for all the wrong reasons. However, let the student of
Machen the Silurist decide for himself. <i>Excavations</i>, containing
reprints of Van Vechten’s earlier reviews and articles,
was published by the alert Mr. Knopf in 1926.</p>

<p>Vincent Starrett’s study of Machen is, I think, more
in sympathy, or at least more to my taste. The title of the
book in which his essay on Machen appears is <i>Buried Caesars</i>—it
enraged me no less than <i>Excavations</i>, and at one time I
regarded these books as two voices in a chorus that had
come not only to praise Machen but to bury him in rather
extravagant prose.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>There has been little news of Arthur Machen or about
Arthur Machen since the late 1920’s. He enjoyed a certain
popularity for perhaps five years, a popularity that lingered
much longer in more literary circles. For the most part
Machen had disappeared from the world of literary figures
just as his books had disappeared from the bookshops. That
he is still read today we know, and we know too, that he
has been slowly gaining new readers through the years.
In 1933 Machen published his last novel, <i>The Green Round</i>.
This has not yet been published in this country, although
it is scheduled for publication this year by August Derleth’s
“Arkham House.” In 1936 there were published in London
two collections of his stories, most of which were reprints<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
of earlier stories with the addition of some new pieces. These
books are <i>The Children of the Pool</i>, published by Hutchinson,
and <i>The Cosy Room</i>, published by Rich and Cowan.
Within the past few years Machen’s stories have appeared
in anthologies put together by Dorothy Sayers, Somerset
Maughan, Phillip Van Doren Stern, Will Cuppy and, of
all people, Boris Karloff!</p>

<p>August Derleth, the youthful sage of Sac Prarie, has
been more active than anyone else in recent years in his
efforts to spread the magic of Machen. Back in 1937, in
the November issue of Ben Abramson’s “Reading and
Collecting,” Derleth published an article on Machen, to
which was appended a bibliography by Nathan Van Patten.
Derleth’s article, the first to appear in almost a decade,
followed the pattern of most previous articles about Machen.
But Derleth has gone beyond prose. He has, from time to
time, included Machen’s more macabre pieces in his various
collections of supernatural stories. He has also published,
or is planning to publish, reprints of several Machen books.</p>

<p>The late H. P. Lovecraft was an admirer of Arthur
Machen’s work and a foremost exponent of the Machen
manner in modern fiction. It is difficult to apply the epithet
“pulp writer” to Lovecraft, but that is, after all, what he
was. Recent appraisals of his work, and the publication in
book form of his stories, have done much to raise him out
of this category. It was Lovecraft who introduced Machen
to August Derleth and to who knows how many thousands
of other readers. In his essay, recently republished by Ben
Abramson, <i>Supernatural Horror in Literature</i>, Lovecraft
supplies one of the most up-to-date, if perhaps one-sided,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
appraisals of Arthur Machen’s work. Lovecraft concentrates
his attention, naturally enough, on Machen’s tales of
horror and the supernatural. The result is a valuable piece
of Machenania but one that should be approached only
by an adept. The chance reader or the casual reader would
receive a rather specialized view of Machen.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>More than one observer of the literary scene has drawn
the obvious parallel between the 1890’s in England and
the 1920’s in our own country. Both periods were characterized
by a sharp break with tradition. In both periods
the younger writers found themselves voluntary exiles from
their own country and both groups selected the same European
city as the scene of their exile. There are other parallels,
... the flood of “little” magazines, the cultivation of the
“continental” attitude, the revival of the art for art’s sake
tradition and a general letting down of the bars once again.
Mr. Waugh, the 1890 Mr. Waugh, might well have written
his <i>Reticence in Literature</i> for the benefit of the new generation
of bold, bad, young intellectuals.</p>

<p>Peter Munro Jack, writing in Malcolm Cowley’s symposium
<i>After the Genteel Tradition</i>, called this the “James
Branch Cabell Period,” and Alfred Kazin, in <i>On Native
Ground</i>, refers to the writers of the Twenties as “The Exquisites,”
while “All the Lost Generations” seems to him
a suitable chapter heading to cover a brief history of the
Twenties.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack credits it all to Cabell’s <i>Jurgen</i> and to novels
by Carl Van Vechten and Eleanor Wylie. “These books,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
says Mr. Jack, “brought to our shores the very spirit of
Rabelais and Voltaire, Balzac, Anatole France and Horace
Walpole, Pater, Wilde, Machen, Max Beerbohm and
Aldous Huxley ... and converted a barbarous literature
over-night into an airy dance of verve, irony and Gallic
sophistication.” Mr. Kazin also begins with <i>Jurgen</i>, which
apparently ushered in “a vogue of elaborate decadence and
enthusiasm, very wicked, world-weary and ornate.” Kazin
goes on to indicate that “just as the pale, imitative exoticism
of the late Nineties had marked not merely the beginnings
of revolt against the old parochialism but a leisure-class
psychology in an America that had finally attained a leisure
class, so that the new literature of sophistication that came
in with the James Branch Cabell School was fundamentally
the ambitious baroque luxury of a period that had finally
obtained a self-conscious splendor of its own.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kazin writes from the vantage point of 1942, and
anything can happen to a critic, a book, or a period in a
dozen or more years. Hindsight used to be considered
superior, in some ways, to foresight—but such is the condition
of the world today that this is no longer particularly
true. Mr. Kazin, writing in the heyday of the four evangelists
of modern American fiction—Don Passos, Hemingway, Farrell
and Steinbeck, looks back upon the era of “baroque
luxury” and “self-conscious splendor” with anything but
nostalgia. Malcolm Cowley, contributing an essay on Dos
Passos to his own symposium, an essay which preceded
Kazin’s book by five years, and to which Mr. Kazin is somewhat
indebted, remarks that Dos Passos had entered college
in those olden baroque days, “at the beginning of a period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
which was later known as that of the Harvard aesthetes.”
This is noted with an almost, but not quite, imperceptible
touch of pride—or of snobbishness. These young Cantabrians,
our boy Dos Passos among them, are reported to
have acted in a manner befitting the Elizabethans, or least
the men of the Nineties, or any other generation that felt
it was living in a Golden Age. They read, Dos Passos still
among them, Pater and <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>, and they explored
the slums of Boston—which must have seemed to
them at least as romantic as Cheapside or Houndsditch.</p>

<p>At any rate Machen was accepted and more or less
widely hailed as one of the more important importations
by some of the little magazines that began to spring up
at this time. “The Reviewer,” one of the most important
of the new journals, published Machen along with Ellen
Glasgow, Joseph Hergesheimer, Ernest Boyd, Ronald Firbank,
Ben Ray Redman, Edwin Muir and others. His public
and enthusiastic acceptance by Van Vechten, that inveterate
organizer of torchlight parades, was quite enough to launch
Machen successfully with the intellectuals who, in those
halcyon days, had scarcely an ideology among them.</p>

<p>It has been said that the writers of this period, motivated
no doubt by the cynicism they either created or absorbed, or
both, tended to escape from this world they never made
and produced in the process of escaping some of the most
exciting and readable books ever written in America. Of
course neither Mr. Cowley nor Mr. Kazin draws exactly
these conclusions—they are rather scornful of the Twenties
and of the books produced in the Twenties.</p>

<p>They are both, Mr. Kazin more than Mr. Cowley since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
he came in later, in rather a hurry to get on to the Thirties
when the Four Horsemen of the Apocryphal were beginning
to gallop madly down the back-country lanes and
through the congested streets of cities and the back-yards
of milltowns. Nevertheless it must be apparent to even the
most ideological reader of these weighty volumes that, for
all their efforts at deprecating the self-conscious splendor of
the period, both Mr. Cowley and Mr. Kazin manage to
make the Twenties sound vastly more entertaining than
the dull period to follow, when the leftist interpretation
of literature placed black Marx against every novel that
showed signs of having been written for the sheer pleasure
of writing, or the desire to create a character or to tell a story.</p>

<p>This seems to be the great fault that is found, by such
men as these, with the novels of that era. They were not
so judged in the Nineteen-Twenties. The sentiments expressed
by Arthur Machen in <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, and echoed in
Cabell’s <i>Beyond Life</i>, were rather widely accepted at the
time, not only by a large portion of the reading public, but
also by members of the more critical profession. Dyson,
however much he may have fussed with his pipes and his
pencils, his notes and his notions, expressed what was the
literary credo of the day; “I will give you the task of a
literary man in a nutshell—to create a wonderful story and
to tell it in a wonderful manner.” And so Cabell and
Wylie and Fitzgerald and Hume and Wilder and many
others created wonderful stories. In this time of man and
to this manner of writing Machen was admirably suited.</p>

<p>People who found New York in the Twenties as
fabulous a city as Machen and Stevenson found London in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
their day, were delighted with the yellow-bound books that
came out under the Borzoi imprint. For many a speakeasy
in the mid-Forties, or in the Village, offered possibilities as
extraordinary as Stevenson’s <i>Suicide Club</i> or <i>The Lost Club</i>
of Machen. Indeed there are undoubtedly those who can
recall when their favorite haunt disappeared over-night and
then, as if by magic, reappeared in the brownstone house
across the street. The city parks, as yet uninhabited by muggers,
were magical places after midnight and lonely as the
sunken lanes of Avalon. Those who delighted in the doings
of Dyson and the adventures of the Young Man in Spectacles
were enchanted by the curious byways of London,
and they shared the satirical views of the dyspeptic Doctor
Stiggins and the Hermit of Barnsbury. It pleased immense
numbers of people who tired of Dreiser to find, in <i>Hieroglyphics</i>,
this perfect reflection of their own attitude: “Imagine
having to spend twenty years with <i>such</i> people.”</p>

<p>The crash in the fall of 1929 was followed by a stunned
silence—and presently one began to hear the hoof beats of
the four frightening Horsemen and the voices of the economical
evangelists crying, and wreaking, havoc.</p>

<p>The realists began to be heard because realism seemed
to be what people wanted—politically, at any rate. The
polemics disguised as novels began to appear in greater
and ever-increasing numbers. It has since become obvious
that realism of this sort was a one-way street to despair—and
it was the realists, not the now-silent “romanticists,”
who were called, in their own time, “The Irresponsibles.”
But with the rise of the proletarian novel, the heroic mill-hand
and the long, dreary lines of the unemployed, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
period came to an end. Machen, along with the others,
ceased to be read except by those who re-read him, or
discovered him in the dusty bookshops where the yellow
binding gleamed from the darkest corner.</p>

<span class="smaller">MACHEN’S MAGIC</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Of recent years there has been a tendency to regard
the novel as something it has become rather than what it
should be. Most novels that do not fall neatly into one of
several categories created by the critics and reviewers are
judged to be poor novels indeed. As a matter of fact, the
whole of fiction, as well as of poetry, has come to be judged
according to standards which, while they may be excellent
standards when applied to journalism or the so-called
“documentary,” serve fiction rather poorly. It has become
the custom to label all stories, novels and poetry that may
fall outside the special categories set up by such standards
as “escapist.” It is a convenient enough classification, and
it is an apt enough description, but the word has come to
be used in a rather derogatory sense.</p>

<p>Now it may be demonstrated by an application of these
very standards that almost every one of the world’s great
books, and every one of the world’s heroic poems, is
“escapist.” And that is, after all, what they were intended
to be. But we are concerned with the telling of a story and
the manner of its telling. To tell a wonderful story in a
wonderful manner, this, says Arthur Machen, is the function<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
of the writer. There is another equally fine description
of the writer’s task, this time by James Branch Cabell, another
story teller of some eminence.</p>

<p>There is in almost all great stories a certain magic that
becomes apparent from the first sentence. One picks up
<i>Moby Dick</i> and reads: “Call me Ishmael.” There is a quality
of strangeness in the name and abruptness of introduction
that serves to set a mood, a mood that persists through the
entire book. Many of Poe’s stories have this same strangeness
and this same quality. One finds it too, in many of
Machen’s stories. The opening sentence, for example of
<i>The Hill of Dreams</i>: “The sky glowed as if great furnace
doors had been opened.”</p>

<p>The magic of Machen depends as much upon his style
as it does upon the magical things of which he writes. His
finest stories appeal to an essential and basic desire for
“escape” from the common life. They depend for their effect
upon that willing suspension of disbelief of which Coleridge
wrote (and for which Coleridge is known by far too
many who would turn its meaning to their own uses), a
suspension of disbelief which it is Mr. Machen’s happy fortune
to bring about almost at will.</p>

<p>And yet, apparently, there is much more to it than
the mere suspension of disbelief—it is rather a desire to
accept such matters as may be set forth, whether or not
they challenge belief—simply because they make an appeal
to <i>instinctive belief</i>. One doesn’t have to try very hard to
believe in the existence of certain powers, especially those
which cannot be, or have not yet been, explained as any
known existing force. From this point onward the development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
of a story by Machen may hinge upon the manner of
telling as well as upon the selection of the materials for
the tale. There must be no fumbling of the matter, no
crude effects, no creaky props, no bolstering up by the
shabby tricks and melodramatic artifices of the penny
dreadfuls. Machen’s magic is very simply achieved. In each
of his tales an improbable, but not implausible, theme is
stated; usually one that is based upon something involving
an instinctive belief, for example: the existence of “little
people,” the continuance of some ancient power under certain
circumstances, and in explaining certain occurrences
or events for which no rational explanation exists. Folk
tales, superstitions, local legends and mythology, most of
these embody certain elements in which most of us have
at least an instinctive belief. Then, too, a great deal of
Mr. Machen’s own particular magic is achieved through
his ability to see things and to present things that are
“removed from the common life.”</p>

<p>Most of Machen’s characters are not unusual people,
they are not especially “peculiar” in any accepted sense
except as they may be affected by certain occurrences in
the earlier development of the story. For example, the young
man in <i>The Novel of the White Powder</i>, the boy in <i>The
Novel of the Black Seal</i>, and the Vaughan girl in <i>The Great
God Pan</i>. But for the most part his characters are, or were,
very ordinary people; ordinary, that is, in the sense that
Dyson and Phillips, and even Lucian Taylor, are quite
ordinary people. Indeed the very ordinariness of some of
these people becomes the starting point of an entire sequence
of extraordinary events. Just as it was the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
qualities of a young married couple visiting relatives of
a Sunday night in a dull, stodgy, respectable suburb of
London that resulted in the strange story called <i>A Fragment
of Life</i>.</p>

<p>Machen’s characters are completely believable, whatever
events may occur, simply because of their very ordinary
qualities. Lucian Taylor, the “hero” of <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>,
an introvert we would call him today, was a normal school
boy who did not conform too well to the rigors of the
Public School System, and whose solitary home life conditioned
him to react as he did to the strangeness of his environment
and to succumb to the influences, real or imagined,
of the Roman ruins near his home. To the development of
such a simple and ordinary character, in this particular story,
must be added one very important magical element—the
influence of landscape upon character.</p>

<p>For the peculiar potency of Machen’s magic owes much,
if not most of its force, to landscape and to the subtle influence
of the weird topography of his stories. Many of
Machen’s most telling effects are achieved through the mere
portrayal of a brooding landscape, the sombre background
of mountains, the deep, rutted lanes that run along between
head-high hedges, solitary hilltops shimmering in heat
waves, old grey houses that sit somberly at the edge of the
forest and rivers that coil in slow esses through forests and
skirt the walls of mountains. There is no doubt that the wild
Welsh countryside had this effect upon Machen himself.</p>

<p>Machen’s first book, it will be remembered, was written
by one “Leolinus Silurensis”—and Machen frequently
calls himself a “Silurist.” For Gwent, in the old days, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
days before Arthur and before the Romans, was the home
of the Silures, one of the three great tribes in this last corner
of the West. The Silures seem to have been more Iberian
than Celtic—they dwelled in the Black Mountains and along
the estuary of the Severn. It was, then, this dark and ancient
land that formed the background of Machen’s life and most
of his work. Machen explains, and illustrates, the influence
of his homeland in <i>Far Off Things</i>:</p>

<p>“This, then, was my process: to invent a story which
would recreate those vague impressions of wonder and awe
and mystery that I myself had received from the form and
shape of the land of my boyhood and youth; and as I thought
over this and meditated on the futility—or comparative
futility—of the plot however ingenious, which did not exist
to express emotions of one kind or another, it struck me that
it might be possible to reverse the process. Could one describe
hills and valleys, woods and rivers, sunrise and sunset,
buried temples and mouldering Roman walls so that a
story should be suggested to the reader? Not, of course, a
story of material incidents, not a story with a plot in the
ordinary sense of the term, but an interior tale of the soul
and its emotions; could such a tale be suggested in the way
I have indicated? Such is to be the plan of the great book
which is not yet written.”</p>

<p>But of course this book was written, not once but over
and over again. One finds its content in almost everything
Machen ever wrote. One discovers too, the influence of
landscape upon Machen and his work. One notes the feeling
for landscape as much in his work as in the work of
Poe or Coleridge or Hawthorne. One day, no doubt, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
learned scholar will write a lengthy monograph upon what
might be called <i>The Influence of Landscape Upon the
Creative Imagination</i>. There are already many footnotes
available for such a work.</p>

<p>Machen recognized this influence, it became apparent
to him as he walked in the land of the Silures and as he
read in the evenings in the drawing room at Llandewi. This
snug, old fashioned “parlour” in the Rectory was the treasure
house of the Machens. Here were their china and silver,
and here the books gathered by the Rector and his forebears.
It was here that Arthur Machen, on his vacations from
school at Hereford, discovered the wonders of Waverly and
DeQuincy. Here, too, was Parker’s <i>Glossary of Gothic Architecture</i>.
This book initiated Machen into the spirit of
Gothic and, as he says, “that is one of the most magical of
all initiations.” Gothic meant to Arthur Machen “the art of
the supreme exaltation, of the inebriation of the body and
soul and spirit. It is not resigned to dwell calmly, stoically,
austerely on the level plains of this earthy life, since its joy
is in this, that it has stormed the battlements of heaven.
And so its far-lifted vaults and its spires rush upward, and
its pinnacles are like a wood of springing trees. And its hard
stones, its strong based pillars break out as it were into
song, they blossom as the rose; all the secrets of the garden
and the field and the wood have been delivered unto them.”</p>

<p>Machen early developed this sense of wonder in the
land. In his reading he discovered, in the age of Coleridge
and Wordsworth, the “renaissance of wonder.” His taste
for Scott and DeQuincy and Coleridge and Poe and Hawthorne
and Parker; his taste, in short, for the “Gothic,” supports<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
and explains this. For landscape and its influence are
important elements in that which we have come to call
“Gothic” ... and it is this Gothic-ness that is also one of
the elements in Machen’s magic.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>And then of course there is the final test of the story-teller’s
magic. Mr. Machen’s inventions have frequently been
taken for truth. The tale of the Bowmen at Mons is the
classic example. Machen has told how he received letters
following the publication of some of his books—letters in
which the writers sought explanations of the stories, letters
which were undoubtedly prompted by a belief in some basic
truth on which they suspected the story had been built.</p>

<p>Many years ago Vincent Starrett wrote, in his preface
to the Chicago edition of <i>The Shining Pyramid</i>, that there
were three Machens—Machen the Saint, Machen the Sorcerer
and Machen the Critic. It is, of course, Machen the
Sorcerer whose work is most popular, or shall we say, the
best known. Machen himself once wrote: “Sorcery and
Sanctity, these are the only true realities.” We might interpret
these to mean religion and science—although it is
doubtful if all of the admirers of Arthur Machen make
this interpretation. At any rate it is the works of Machen
the Sorcerer that have been most widely anthologized. These
are the stories one finds classified under such headings as
“supernatural stories, tales of terror, horror stories” and
the like.</p>

<p>Let us admit that supernatural fiction, supernatural
tales, have quite a respectable lineage. It must not be imagined,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
as some intellectuals do, that the tale of terror is
something to which only the readers of pulp magazines are
addicted. The supernatural tale has been the subject of several
excellent studies. One has only to mention the work
of such admirable scholars as Dorothy Scarborough, Edith
Birkhead, Montague Summers and Eino Railo.</p>

<p>It has been said by some of these scholarly investigators
that almost every English writer of any importance has, at
one time or another, written at least one story or novel
that fits somewhere into one of these categories. And then,
of course, the scholarly investigators proceed to give reasons
for the interest in such stories, and they point out that the
interest as well as the belief in such matters is always in
direct proportion to the ruggedness of the terrain. And they
also list, as evidence of the extent of their research, the means
whereby the best effects may be achieved in this particular
field. Basically these have to do with landscape, architecture,
antiquity and a whole collection of odds and ends, of props
and stage settings that form the background for the venerable
school of Gothic literature started many years ago by
Horace Walpole in <i>The Castle of Otranto</i>.</p>

<p>One thing all of these tales have in common is, naturally
enough, strangeness. A strangeness in landscape, a
strangeness in character. Basically too, one supposes, these
stories are written about, and because of, men’s fears. That
is why they are called ghost stories, or horror stories, or tales
of terror. This fear is not merely a fear of the dead returned,
but of the past. For these stories concern themselves, even
when not with actual ghosts, with past glories, past powers,
past civilizations, and ancient ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>It is not that man seeks to frighten himself that he
reads these stories and is fascinated by them. Psychologists,
of one sort or another, have said that the popularity of
ghost stories and mystery novels can be traced to a desire
to enjoy vicariously the precarious situations in which characters
in these tales find themselves; and that by substituting
themselves for the characters involved the readers may obtain
a certain stimulation which is lacking in their humdrum,
calm and civilized lives. This, it seems to me, is not particularly
true. It is rather because the past <i>is</i> the past—simply that
and nothing more. For the past is the one thing man can
never alter, although it has become fashionable for us to try
even that. The present is here, the future is attainable and
forseeable and it may even be influenced. The past is unattainable
and will always remain so, therefore man remains
fascinated by it. The more shrouded in the mists of time
and of antiquity, the more fascinating. Man does not read
of the past to frighten himself any more than he drinks in
order to experience a hang-over. Nor does the average
reader of supernatural stories identify himself with primitive
men’s fears any more than he identifies himself with
the abstract forces for good or evil when reading detective
stories. Man is a curious creature and his curiosity leads
him into strange places. His curiosity concerning his amazing
curiosity leads him to even stranger conclusions.</p>

<p>This preoccupation with the Past is part of man’s
eternal preoccupation with Time; is now, and always shall
be, world without end; from the days of the early Greeks,
who knew that Chronos was the father of great Jupiter himself—the
parent of the father of the Gods. Many years ago<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
J. W. Dunne wrote a strange and tantalizing book, <i>An Experiment
with Time</i>, a book much remarked by critics and
book reviewers in the practice of their trade, but seldom
quoted beyond a mere mention of its title. This is an extraordinary
book, perhaps out-dated now, in this age of the
supersonic and the expanding universe and the expanding
ego. Nevertheless, H. G. Wells and Kipling have been influenced
by it; and many another creator of the marvelous
and the wonderful. One may read many strange and wonderful
books, one may even read strong and powerful and
significant books—but one never forgets such books and
plays written about the Time theme as <i>The Time Machine</i>
and <i>Berkeley Square</i>, Priestley’s <i>I Have Been Here Before</i>,
Ford Madox Ford’s <i>Ladies Whose Bright Eyes</i> and many
others.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The magic of Machen is due no less to his wonderful
style than to his wonderful material. In these days when
one can scarcely speak of style without being considered
stuffy and perhaps even pedantic, to praise a writer for
his style is almost to damn him with faint praise. This is
undoubtedly because we have had no stylists for the last
several decades, for which, on the whole, we may well be
grateful! It is possible that stylists fell into disrepute because
so many of them, in the past, concealed a tremendous
vacuum and a cavernous nothingness beneath and behind
a facile facade of fluency.</p>

<p>Yet Arthur Machen has a distinctive style, the perfection
of which, while it appeals to the pedantic and
soothes the scholarly, must be apparent even to the readers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
of those horrendous anthologies which have reprinted
Machen while the scholars were busily interring him in their
fascinating mausoleums. This matter of style is rather a
tricky one. It is the sort of thing of which one might say,
as some have, and when all definitions fail, “Either one
has it, or—one hasn’t!” However feelingly and with whatever
academic finality this axiom may be delivered—style
is obviously more than that, and more than the man. More,
too, than words and a certain way of putting them together,
and much more than a mere choice of words or dexterity
in manipulating them. We have come to think that many
of these things <i>do</i> constitute style. Indeed, a certain publisher
recently hailed a new book (one of his own, of course)
as being in the “tradition of the English Stylists.” Simply
because the writer employed, here and there, a compound-complex
sentence, composed with a certain felicity and
manufactured of polysyllabic words or those with a certain
antique charm. It is felt, then, that a matter of phrases
makes a Fielding—which is no more the case than that the
use of a quotation from Donne makes a writer one to stand
with the Elizabethans.</p>

<p>Style is, like so many other things, more apparent in
the breach than in the observance, which comes perilously
close to the didactic dictum, “Either you have it, or—you
haven’t.” But not quite. To be sure, every written word or
group of words has style, even roadsigns, notices of trespass,
mayors’ proclamation, editorials in the Daily Worker,
even soap operas have style. The most popular writers of
pot-boilers have a style—and many of them have so pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
a style that they can be and have been recognizably
parodied.</p>

<p>It might be said of a good style that it is one that
cannot be parodied. An examination of Machen’s style
would indicate that it is, in his case at least, quite true. For
Machen’s style is a blend of many things; of words with
magic connotation, of sentences that create moods, of
passages that suggest, subtly and almost unconsciously, the
exact atmosphere for which they were intended. Mr. Machen
is a master at evoking the willing suspension of disbelief,
and he does it without employing any of the stock properties
listed by Coleridge and other authorities as having the
proper connotative value for the creation of a “Gothic”
mood or atmosphere.</p>

<p>When all is said and done, however, it must be admitted
that Machen’s style is merely a reflection of his faith in
the credo of a literary man as set forth by the admirable
Dyson. And here, of course, we come to the crux of the matter,
and as close as we may to an explanation of Machen’s
magic which cannot, after all, be appraised in rational terms.
In that wonderful book called <i>Hieroglyphics</i> Machen poses
a series of questions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Explain, in rational terms, The Quest of the Holy
Graal. State whether in your opinion such a vessel ever existed,
and if you think it did not, justify your pleasure in
reading an account of the search for it.”</p>

<p>“Explain, logically, your delight in color.”</p>

<p>“Estimate the value of Westminster Abbey in the
avoirdupois measure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“Faery lands forlorn. Draw a map of the district in
question, putting in principal towns and naming exports.”</p>

</div>

<p>Machen agrees that one cannot express art of any kind
in the terms of rationalism, and that “If literature be a kind
of dignified reporting, in which the reporter is at liberty to
invent new incidents and leave out others, and to arrange
all in the order that pleases him best; then, let us have as
much “common sense” and “rationalism” as you please ...
but if literature is a mysterious ecstasy, the withdrawal from
all common and ordinary conditions ... [we had better]
confess that with its first principles logic has nothing to do....
For if Rationalism be the truth, then all literature ...
is simply lunacy.”</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>There are, sometimes, certain superficial resemblances
between the works of imaginative writers that are outside the
province and beyond the charge of plagiarism. An age produces
a culture, a culture produces works of art, and all
the while the individual consciousness, or sub-consciousness,
feeds upon and is nourished by the raw materials and the
basic elements of the culture. For in any age there are
bound to exist certain individuals in whom combinations
of common experience develop along certain lines and who
may be expected to react in almost predictable patterns to
identical stimulae ... just as certain identical combinations
of chemical elements may be expected to react in
identical manner under identical circumstances. Which is,
after all, no major discovery but merely a restatement of
the obvious fact that lies behind the continuity of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
culture, or even, on a smaller scale, of any literary movement,
or on occasion, of something less significant than a
literary movement.</p>

<p>This fact also lies behind the periodical resurgence of
certain ideals of culture or revivals of interest in certain
abstractions such as realism, naturalism, romanticism and
the like. And it explains, in individuals, the influence one
writer may have over another, or the appeal of certain types
of material to certain similar individuals.</p>

<p>Superficial resemblances are a common manifestation
of spiritual relationships. Some years ago a rather clever
critic of music wrote a book called <i>Music for the Man Who
Enjoys Hamlet</i>. Now, the resemblance between people who
enjoy Hamlet no doubt extends to a great many things
other than the stage and Shakespeare and music, and, for
all we know, it might even be established that such people
have a mutual preference for a specific cocktail or a certain
brand of cigarette. Our critic did not attempt to prove this,
he contented himself with discussing music of a type to
soothe the Hamlet-enjoying intellect. And so the superficial
resemblances between Poe and Coleridge and DeQuincy
extend far beyond a need or addiction, accidental or otherwise,
to stimulants of one sort or another. The lines that
connect and link these individuals, feature for feature,
element for element, with an incomplete analogy here, and
a broken chain there, would no doubt resemble a physicist’s
laboratory model of the atomic structure of the very newest
isotope of the most recently discovered element.</p>

<p>Perhaps individuals themselves constitute the electrons
and protons of a cultural atom. We might link individuals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
of a certain sort, the men who enjoy Hamlet, for example,
or Poe, DeQuincy, Hawthorne, Coleridge, and find isotopes
here too—Brockden-Brown, Walter Scott, Tieck, Machen,
Sheil, Stevenson, Wells and so on and so on. And we
would find that these elements or individuals had certain
affinities, certain properties in common. They are not alike
merely in that they wrote in a certain fashion, or that they
wrote about more or less similar ideas, or that the moods
they created were more or less identical. There are certain
other qualities, perhaps insignificant, but revealing.</p>

<p>Poe, like Coleridge, was fond of designing title pages
and planning magazines and journals of a very literary
sort. We find that Poe and Coleridge shared a facility for
creating exotic and quite unreal localities. For example
Coleridge’s Pleasure Palace of Kubla Khan and Poe’s
Domain of Arnheim are very similar in conception. The
conception of tremendous wealth appealed, in a most impractical
way, to both Poe and Coleridge. And, finally, both
shared a great liking for names of Oriental origin ... there
is no distance at all, on the literary map, between Xanadu
and the kingdom by the sea; and the River Alph or one of
its tributaries, empties into the tarn of Auber. Machen’s
own landscape is not too far removed. It was first peopled
by the dark people who came from Defrobani, which is to
say the City of the Golden Domes, far to the east on the
shores of Marmora. And Machen’s eternal preoccupation
with a Great Romance is akin in many ways to Poe’s grandiose
schemes for epic compositions no less than it is to the
complete unpublished works of Coleridge.</p>

<p>There was magic in these men and in their manner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
telling a tale. There was, in each of them, an ability to
create that which made its strongest appeal to that love
of strangeness in most men’s minds.</p>

<p>DeQuincy, alone in London; Hawthorne, so solemnly
settled in Salem, Coleridge surrounded by blue-stockings
and blue lakes; Poe in his erratic course from salon to
saloon ... these men made magic of a sort no realist
could ever devise. Machen’s magic is of this sort.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PATTERN</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Toward the close of the first quarter of this century
Mr. Alfred Knopf, being ready to reissue <i>The Anatomy of
Tobacco</i>, asked Arthur Machen to write a new introduction
for the volume. The <i>Anatomy</i> had been written some forty-three
years before and it seemed time a new edition and a
new introduction were called for. The <i>Anatomy</i> is a slight
book, and a rather dull and pretentious one, turned out as
a sort of sophomoric exercise under the influence of Burton
and other pedantic antiquarians. Machen had no objection
to writing a new introduction to the book of “Leolinus
Siluriensis” and so he sat down at once to do so.</p>

<p>Most of Machen’s work, and certainly all of the best
of it, had already been written and published ... there
was no Great Romance on the fire just then. Several years
before he had written his memoirs, or come as close to
writing them as he ever would. <i>The Confessions of a
Literary Man</i> appeared serially in the London Evening
News through several months of 1915. Secker issued the
<i>Confessions</i> in 1922 as <i>Far Off Things</i>. A year later Machen
wrote <i>Things Near and Far</i>; another two years later came
<i>The London Adventure</i>. These three books are Machen’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
autobiography, although it has been said that almost everything
he ever wrote was, to a great extent, autobiographical.
At any rate, Machen saw the books in print and occupied
himself with journalism, which he detested, and with thinking
over the books he had written which, on the whole, he
rather enjoyed. And so when, in the 1920’s, he began the
New York Adventure, Machen sat down and wrote not
one but a whole series of new introductions. There is no
nonsense about these introductions, and no “graceful writing.”
The introduction to the new edition of the <i>Anatomy</i>
begins quite simply:</p>

<p>“It struck me once, during a long meditation on literature,
that every man who has written has had but one idea
in his head. To the best of my recollection, the particular
example in my mind at the time was Edgar Allen Poe, who
executed a wonderful series of variations on one theme.”</p>

<p>Now this idea had been in Machen’s mind for a great
many years. A year or two before completing his introduction
for Mr. Knopf he had been engaged in writing a book
called <i>The London Adventure</i>. The book contains much
material that is found in neither the <i>Confessions</i> nor in
<i>Things Near and Far</i>. While writing the book he became
intrigued with some old note books he had kept many years
before. In reading them he was reminded of a story by
Henry James, <i>The Pattern on the Carpet</i>, in which is expressed
the notion of a man of letters who had written
many books and was quite surprised to find that one of
his admirers had failed to recognize that all these tales of
his were variations on one theme; that a common pattern,
like the pattern of an eastern carpet ran through them all.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
In the story the novelist died suddenly without revealing
the nature of the pattern. Nor does Henry James, in whose
works one might also trace a common pattern. He too
leaves it to his readers to discover for themselves the mystery
of this one design, latent in a whole shelf of books.</p>

<p>Machen himself has such a pattern, and such a theme.
It occurs again and again in all of his works, in his short
stories as well as in his novels: in the slightest of his essays
as well as in <i>Hieroglyphics</i>. This theme he defines in several
places quite briefly and simply. It is, he says, “The sense
of the eternal mysteries, the eternal beauty hidden beneath
the crust of common and commonplace things: hidden and
yet burning and glowing continuously if you care to look
with purged eyes.”</p>

<p>We have noted, several times over, Machen’s preoccupation
with a Great Romance. Many years ago he wrote,
“There is a great book that I am hoping to write one of
these fine days. I have been hoping to write it, I may say,
since 1898, or ’99, and somewhere about the later year I
did write as many as a dozen pages. The <i>magnum opus</i> so
far conducted did not wholly displease me, and yet it was
not good enough to urge me forward in the task. And so
it has languished ever since then, and I am afraid I have
lost the manuscript that contained all that there was of it
long ago. Seriously, of course, it would not have been a
great book if it had been ever so prosperously continued
and ended; but it would have been at least a curious book,
and even now I feel conscious of warm desire at the thought
of writing it—some day. For the idea came to me as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“I had been thinking at the old century end of the
work that I had done in the fifteen years or so before, and
it suddenly dawned upon me that this work, pretty good
or pretty bad, or as it may be, had all been the expression
of one formula, one endeavor. What I had been doing was
this: I had been inventing tales in which and by which I
had tried to realize my boyish impressions of that wonderful
magic Gwent.”</p>

<p>Now this great book was not only written but it was
rewritten under various forms, in entirely different ways,
and with no surface similarities at all. For almost sixty
years he had written purely to please himself, nor did he
hesitate to publish, at his own expense, the books he wrote
for his own pleasure. It was his feeling in this that there
was no reason why a beginner should not be willing to
pay his own way. And yet, as he says, it is a queer pleasure
when one does write to please oneself. For, as Machen
says,</p>

<p>“I wrote purely to please myself; and what a queer
pleasure it was! To write, or to try to write, means involving
oneself in endless difficulties, contrarieties, torments,
despairs, and yet I wrote on, and I suppose for the reason
which I have given, the necessity laid upon most of us to
create another and a fantastic life in order that the life of
actuality may be endurable.”</p>

<p>In these excerpts from Machen’s autobiographical
sketches one encounters over and over again certain keywords:
‘escape,’ ‘common life,’ ‘eternal mysteries,’ ‘removal’
and so on. And these same key words are, of course, the
underlying themes of every story he ever wrote. They constitute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
the criteria by which he judged the literature of past
and present as well.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Machen had been brought up on Scott and Coleridge,
Hawthorne and Poe and all the authors one would naturally
expect a school boy to encounter in an English public
school in the 1880’s. In addition to these there were the
books he found in the rectory at Llanddewi. These included
one especially significant book by Parker on Gothic architecture.</p>

<p>We have already noted that Machen early became
aware of the beauty of the Gothic and that he was all of
his life more or less under its influence. His conception of
the Gothic was not quite the same as Horace Walpole’s.
It stemmed rather from Parker and from Coleridge, from
whom he learned that there is “in the spectacle of external
nature something much more than mere pleasantness or
sensuous beauty.” The rugged terrain of the land of the
Silures would seem to offer little of pleasantness or sensuous
beauty ... yet it did act upon Machen in much the same
way that such a landscape had acted upon the imagination
of such a lyrical poet as, for example, Wordsworth.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Machen did not hesitate to refer
to Walpole’s “sham Gothic,” and he assumes that Walpole
had a sort of “vague idea that there was something in a
particular architecture of a particular era which was somehow
or other curious and admirable.” Machen further remarks
that one cannot possibly compare the school of Coleridge
in its appreciation of nature with the school of Walpole
in its appreciation of the Gothic. And then, he poses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
a question in which there lies the answer to his own and
to many another writer’s problem. “May it not be that
Coleridge and his fellows were but the forerunners of a
new doctrine which was not fully revealed to them.”</p>

<p>We have remarked that Machen employs none of the
traditional trappings of the Gothic tale. There are no clankings
and bumpings and ghosties in the night. There are
no ruined castles, no hermits in caves. Instead we find
deserted houses in Lambeth and in Clerkenwell, and sometimes
the houses are not even deserted. Nor are they occupied
by monks or knights or old families in whose closets
lurk the most deplorable of skeletons. The typical Gothic
“hero,” either the sardonic Byronic or the melancholy Manfred
type is never encountered. Machen’s heroes, if such
they be, are rather ordinary young men like Lucian Taylor
and Ambrose Meyrick, or perhaps you may wish to call
the ever-present Dyson and the companionable Phillips
heroes. There are, of course, sinister characters in Machen.
Mr. Davies, outwardly ordinary, is as black a villain as can
be found anywhere in the whole school of Otranto. Miss
Lally, or Miss Leicester, are as horrific in their own quiet
way as any harpy or hag encountered in the novels of Radcliff.</p>

<p>Arthur Machen is much more closely related in his
work to Hawthorne and Poe than he is to his English contemporaries
and predecessors. As Paul Elmer More has
noted, Hawthorne and Poe are the only two writers in
America who have won almost universal renown as artists,
and that these two are each, in their own manner, a sovereign
in that strange region of emotion which we name the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
weird. Their achievement, as Mr. More points out, is not
at all like the Gothic novel introduced by Horace Walpole.
There is little in them of the revival of medieval superstition
and gloom which marked the rise of romanticism
in Europe.</p>

<p>The unearthly visions of Poe and Hawthorne were not
the results of literary whim or unbridled individualism but,
according to Mr. More, were deeply rooted in American
history. Now this is a rather strange matter, for there is
nothing nationalistic in the nature of the work of these
American writers. It follows a well established tradition,
but it is not the tradition of the English school of the
Gothic revival. It was greatly influenced by Germanic mysticism,
just as Coleridge was influenced by Teutonic theory.
These American writers seem to have missed the dilettantism
that was associated with the Gothic revival in England.
In this they are very close to Machen and his work. Both
these writers were greatly influenced by their surroundings
and by the influence of their own native landscape. The
personal alchemy of each one transmuted the elements of
that landscape and created a time and place that never were.</p>

<p>Poe especially, and to a far greater extent, was affected
by landscape not only of his native Virginia but of
every place he ever visited. Some years ago John Cowper
Powys, a visiting, but much more sympathetic than usual,
Englishman commented upon this aspect of the writings
of Poe:</p>

<p>“For myself, as a traveller for a score of years between
all of Edgar Allen Poe’s particular cities, and knowing the
country round them a good deal better than I know my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
own, I confess—though it may be because of a kindred
sensibility toward the ghostly, the weird, and the horror
hinting: I have found even in those districts, though of
course far more in the deeper south, elements here and
there that correspond with disturbing closeness to the
frightening things in his imaginary landscape.</p>

<p>“But it is not from those pine haunted woods and
those morasses and those treacherous estuaries and those
Lethean wharfs that the darker vistas and more troubling
visions of Poe’s inspirations comes.</p>

<p>“They are conjured up from the symbols of pre-incarnate
tremblings that we all find written on the nerves of
our race—though only a few abnormal individuals can
render articulate these hieroglyphics of holy terror.</p>

<p>“... We all conceal within us, inherited from an
immemorial past, a secret yearning to enjoy by some magical
shortcut the hidden potencies of nature. A responsive
pulse begins to beat irrepressibly within us when Faust
makes the sign of the Macrocosm, for there is not one
among us for whom the idea of forbidden joys and an
unnatural power over the forces of nature has not got a
seductive appeal.”</p>

<p>Machen made this comment in a letter on the subject
of the Gothic novel. “The fact is, I believe, that all the
Gothic romances are sham Gothic romances. I mean that
the people who put back their period into the middle
ages, had hardly the faintest notion of what life in the
middle ages, in a Gothic castle was really like. This, let
me note, is nothing against their books as literature or else
we should be laughing at a highly esteemed writer for supposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
that ninth century life at Elsinore had the remotest
resemblance to the life which is depicted in <i>Hamlet</i>.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The books of Arthur Machen which have gained the
greatest amount of attention are, naturally enough, the
more sensational stories in which he touches upon themes
that approach what is, or what has been in the past, forbidden
territory. It seems odd that Arthur Machen, whose
works have been so generally neglected, should have been
scolded on occasion by various critics for his use of sexual
themes. Actually there is no sexuality as such in any of
Arthur Machen’s books. It does enter into some of the
stories through the medium of mythology, Roman or Celtic,
and sometimes aboriginal. And yet, such a critic as the
gentle A. E. Houseman, could write of him, “Mixing up
religion and sexuality is not a thing I am fond of.” Mr.
Houseman, had he possessed something of Machen’s scholarship,
would have perceived that religion and sexuality
were not mixed up by Arthur Machen but rather by his
own Celtic or Teutonic or Scandinavian ancestors. It is the
more surprising, however, that such opinions as that expressed
by the later great poet have not resulted in greater
popularity for at least some of the work of Arthur Machen.</p>

<p>By far the most important elements in the pattern that
runs through Machen’s work are the very ones he himself
expressed many years ago, “The sense of the eternal mysteries
and the eternal beauty hidden beneath the crust of
common and commonplace things.”</p>

<p>The reputation of Arthur Machen undoubtedly rests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
most securely on a single book, <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, and on perhaps
a half dozen of his essays. His definition of what constitutes
fine literature is, even today, beyond dispute. His
thoughts on realism, or naturalism, a movement that was
only just beginning to be felt in his youth have been admirably
expressed in a passage in his book <i>The Secret
Glory</i>.</p>

<p>“Of course, he said, (Ambrose Meyrick) I take realism
to mean absolute and essential truthfulness of description,
as opposed to merely conventional treatment. Zola
is a realist not—as the imbeciles suppose because he described—well,
rather minutely—many unpleasant sights and
sounds and smells and emotions, but because he was a poet,
a seer; because, in spite of his pseudo philosophies, his
cheap materialisms, he saw the true heart, the reality of
things. Take <i>La Terre</i>, do you think it is realistic because
it describes minutely, and probably faithfully, the event of
a cow calving? Not in the least; the local vet who was
called in could probably do all that as well or better. It is
realistic because it goes behind all the brutality, all the
piggeries and inhumanities, of those frightful people, and
shows us the strange, mad, transcendent passion that lay
behind all those things—the wild desire for the land—a
longing that burned, that devoured, that inflamed, that
drove men to hell and death as would a passion for a goddess
who might never be attained. Remember how ‘La
Beauce’ is personified, how the earth swells and quickens
before one, how every clod and morsel of the soil cries for
its service and its sacrifice and its victims—I call that realism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>“Of course, there may be people who think that if
you describe a pigsty well you are a realist, and if you
describe an altar well you are romantic.... I do not know
that the mental processes of Cretins form a very interesting
subject for discussion.”</p>

<p>Frank Norris, an early apostle of realism, wrote, while
he was still at college, this analysis of realism and of Zola:
“Naturalism, as understood by Zola, is but a form of romanticism
after all ... the naturalist takes no note of
common people, common in so far as their interests, their
lives and the things that occur in them are common, are
ordinary. Terrible things must happen to the characters of
the naturalistic tale. They must be twisted from the ordinary,
wrenched from the quiet, uneventful round of
everyday life and flung into the throes of a vast and terrible
drama that works itself out in unleashed passions, in blood
and in sudden death.”</p>

<p>There are many provocative passages on this subject
in Machen. Take, for example, these thoughts expressed in
Machen’s <i>The Art of Dickens</i>:</p>

<p>“... it is not the main point in the finest literature
to draw people so well that the reader begins to think that
they must be ‘real’ people, and that the author is a sort of
journalist with supernatural means of finding all the facts
about them.”</p>

<p>“If we want to go to Margate, it would be idle to
take a fairy barque, and <i>simili modo</i> it would be but faint
praise of a Gothic cathedral to say that it was quite weather
proof.”</p>

<p>“What does it profit a painter to delineate a tree which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
is very like a tree, unless it is something much more—unless
it is also the symbol and the revelation of some great
secret of nature? If this were not so, then the camera would
be superior of Turner, and the shorthand writer would
look down from his desk on poor blind Homer, who talks
of gods and goddesses of fairy isles, and giants with one
eye in their foreheads.”</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Vincent Starrett many years ago made the statement
that there was little humor in Arthur Machen’s works. Of
humor, in the broadest Mark Twain, or even in the gentle
Stephen Leacock vein, there is very little. But there is
in almost all of Machen a wry, dry humor with perhaps a
rather bitter taste. There are passages, even in <i>The Hill of
Dreams</i> that are as humorous as anything by Leacock. One
reads his account of the publishing business as it was in
his day with a realization that Machen is as much at home
in satire as in sorcery. His autobiographical books are filled
with humor, this time not so bitter. Many of his essays employ
humor and satire in generous doses. Shortly after the
publication of <i>The Hill of Dreams</i> and <i>The House of Souls</i>
Arthur Machen wrote several essays on the subject of the
Holy Graal. These essays, the first of which appeared under
the editorship of A. E. Waite, aroused quite a bit of
attention and resulted in a certain amount of controversy
in antiquarian circles. The Graal legends through their
association with Arthur and Caerleon had been of great
interest to Machen from his earliest years.</p>

<p>He knew every legend and every theory in the literature
of the Graal. His first essay was at variance with some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
of the new theories that were then springing up. Chief
among these was the theory that the Graal legends had
their basis in a fertility cult which persisted in Wales right
up until Norman times. Machen promptly branded this
theory as absurd. “Let us grant,” he wrote, “that the question
of fertility, which is the question of life, both for ourselves
and for our cabbages, is behind everything. If we
go far back enough, it is clear that we can do nothing in
this world if we are so unlucky as to be dead: and this
applies equally to the Phallic hypothesis of the origin of
everything, which can be worked in very well with the
fertility hypothesis. The whole point of a great many of
the rites in fertility ceremonies seems to be built about the
hypothesis that fertility could be enduced by certain ceremonies
that were expected to put nature in a mood to be
fertile.” And then Machen quotes from one of the experts
who clung to this hypothesis, “Just as the sailor imitates
the wind that he desires by whistling for it, so did the
countrymen imitate the trees in the wood by making a mock
tree called the Maypole.”</p>

<p>Machen seems willing enough to accept these theories
but he asks, “What light shall we gain as to the actual
emotions and intent of the seventeenth or sixteenth century
people who danced about the Maypole? I venture to say
none whatever ... they were not addressing any invocation
to the woods or anything else. They were being jolly
or merry at a certain time of the year in a traditional manner.
For all I know, our learned people may decide that the
game of marbles was originally a reminder to the spheres
to keep on rolling. If I am told so, I shall not deny the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
doctrine, but I shall maintain that the boys who play marbles
on London pavements know nothing of it. Granted
this hypothetical origin of marbles, it has nothing whatever
to do with the game of the twentieth century.”</p>

<p>The note books of Arthur Machen, as fragmentarily
revealed in <i>The London Adventure</i>, are as fascinating as
are the notebooks of Hawthorne, which as a matter of fact
they much resemble. For example there are many notes
concerned with patterns—and these bear a direct relationship
with the earlier material in this chapter. Most of the
notes concern labyrinths, mazes, spirals and whorls. He asks
the question: Why was this form common to all primitive
art? And then, in almost the same place in his note book
one finds the sentence: “Literature began with charms, incantations,
spells, songs of mystery, chants of religious
ecstasy, the Bachic chorus, the rune, the mass.” This sentence
is the basis for <i>Hieroglyphics</i>. It is, according to
Machen, the thesis of the book fairly well summed up in
one sentence.</p>

<p>And this same pattern occurs in most of his stories.
Among his notes we find this, “The maze was not only
the instrument but the symbol of ecstasy; it was a pictured
‘inebriation,’ the sign of some age old process that gave
the secret bliss to men, that was symbolized also by dancing,
by lyrics with their recurring burdens, and their repeated
musical phrases: a maze, a dance, a song: three symbols
pointing to one mystery.”</p>

<p>It would require a thorough examination of the notebook
of Arthur Machen, if such a thing were possible,
by a man with the skill and scholarship of a John Livingston<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
Lowes to trace and to tell the complete story of the
pattern in Arthur Machen. Yet here, in brief, and in all
his works, the pattern is everywhere apparent.</p>

<p>There are, undoubtedly, those who prefer Machen the
essayist to Machen the story teller. Certainly his greatest
work, <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, is sufficient reply to those who have
tried to dismiss Machen as the creator of “shockers” concerned
with demonology and sensational horror stories.
The delightful pieces that appeared serially in the Lyons
Mail and the Illustrated News and the London Graphic
would please even the Manchester Guardian or A. E. Houseman,
who once wrote that he found Machen not quite to
his taste. His essays on the Grail legend are authoritative
without being archeological, witty without being flippant
or, what would have been unbearable, satirical.</p>

<p>And yet, in the essays no less than in the stories, the
pattern is there and is recognizable. One is forever running
across a phrase or a notion one has encountered before—some
where, some time, some place—and the place usually
turns out to be another Machen essay. For the pattern of
Machen’s thinking is as obvious as the pattern in the rug;
as obvious, and as simple, as the definitions supplied in
<i>Hieroglyphics</i>. The pattern is, as we know, summed up in
the phrase: “removal from the common life.” It may be
simplified further in the one word: “ecstasy.”</p>

<p>Now the word “ecstasy” has caused some confusion
in the minds of certain of Machen’s detractors as well as
among his admirers. There was a tendency, in the Twenties,
as well as in the Nineties, to give the word “ecstasy”
a connotation or a meaning similar to that employed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
the popular novelists of the time. “Ecstasy” seemed to many
to be the “ecstasy” of the pallid, perverted creatures of the
Cafe Royale and, later, a sort of Elinor Glynn-ish, sinnish
quality. It was a word much favored by the writers of
romances, the practitioners of the purple phrase. And so
we encounter, at times, this “novelist of ecstasy and sin”
sort of nonsense.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, that excellent
volume of literary criticism having little to do with
passion, in or out of the desert, bears the illuminating subtitle:
“<i>A Note Upon Ecstasy in Literature</i>.” And <i>this</i> ecstasy
is of the mind—it is an exultation of the spirit of men. It
is, to go back to the more descriptive phrase, the removal
from the common life.</p>

<p>This pattern exists everywhere in Machen, sometimes
it is developed by the characters and circumstances in his
tales, or again it is carried out by argument or analysis in
his essays, but always, upon closer examination, the grand
design is apparent.</p>

<p>One may read, for example, the essay called <i>The Hidden
Mystery</i> and find that it is almost exactly the same as
<i>The Mystic Speech</i>. And then one reads <i>The Secret Glory</i>
and finds, once again, the same theories, the same logic,
the same figures and the same conclusions, expressed and
explained as only Machen can set them down. This may
send the casual reader, or even the amateur bibliographer,
hunting from volume to volume with pencil and reading
glass, for there seems to be indeed a hidden mystery, a
mystic speech, a glorious secret in these passages and paragraphs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>Actually, of course, one is merely becoming aware of
the pattern, and one is becoming impressed with the simplicity
and the one-ness of everything Machen ever wrote.
Of course there are actual resemblances between the essays
mentioned and strong connections between them and the
book. For the essays were written years before, and one of
them was actually delivered as a lecture before the learned
Quest Society of London. They are all a part of the book
that is now known as <i>The Secret Glory</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE VERITABLE REALISTS</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Our modern civilization is, if nothing else, a well-documented
one. No sooner were we at war than we began
to talk about the post-war world. Our introduction to
the marvels of the post-war world began very shortly after
Pearl Harbor. Prophets sprang up in every advertising
agency and began to lead us into the promised land of the
push button and the ever-present plastics—where every prospect
was pleasantly postwar-ish and only man seemed likely
to remain vile, as indeed he proved by brilliantly discovering
how to smash the atom. It was significant that the art
of propaganda, perfected to the point of art by the original
perpetrators of the war, should become the means of showing
us the wondrous shape of things to come.</p>

<p>So well indoctrinated were our people, so thoroughly
documented had we become, that it occurred to many to
venture opinions on the state of man in this almost perfect
state of the future. It was obvious, even to the prophets,
that man would engage in activities other than pushing buttons
to start and to stop things, to change climate or a
record, to launch a war, a ship or a new hydro-electric plant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
It seemed obvious, even to the prophets, that there might
be malice in this wonderland.</p>

<p>Man, with more leisure than ever before, would undoubtedly
manage to stir up more trouble than ever before.
And while we certainly were not going to sell apples on
street corners, we knew enough, we said, to look for an
increase in crime, a new wave of disillusionment and, most
certainly, a new point of view.</p>

<p>We were quite resigned to these things. We were prepared
to usher in a brave new world to the tune of some
fantastic Gotterdammerung in the Bavarian Redoubt. The
suicide of the Austrian Corporal was anti-climax indeed,
since everyone knew, had known for years, that he had it
in him. Things shuddered to a slow halt in Europe and the
post-war world seemed about to be launched with nothing
more stupendous in the offing than the truth about V-1, 2
and 3. The atom’s howl at Hiroshima came as the cataclysmic
climax.</p>

<p>Well, then, once again we had fought in a great war
and once again had emerged comparatively victorious. Because
victors always anticipate a certain course of events
which, we have yet to learn, never follow victory, we had
already anticipated the cynicism that was to follow. At
least we have learned to anticipate the cynicism, and that
of course is an achievement. It represents, one must admit,
progress. In developing and enlarging upon our visions of
the push-button world we had not neglected to include the
conception of push-button wars. This could be called the
crowning cynicism—and a less disillusioned world might
well do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>But it is probable that our cynicism is really not quite
so bitter as it was the last time, because one isn’t really
cynical at discovering that what one never believed in does
not exist. At any rate we felt, and perhaps we still do, that
there was a pattern to be followed. We have had some
prior knowledge of the pattern—it was becoming familiar
to us. There might be, of course, some slight variations
here and there. For example: in tracing out the pattern
before, our cynicism resulted in an escape into realism—and
this time it might result in an escape from realism.
Cynicism in 1947 or 1948 might very well be an isotope
of uranium 235, with a few unknown qualities but with a
predictably high escape-velocity.</p>

<p>The post-war era seems to be fairly familiar. The
political scene conforms in a great many respects—but our
reactions do not. That we will do exactly the same thing
about exactly the same problem is not only unthinkable, it
is extremely unlikely. Blunder we very probably will, but
we will have found new ways of blundering. After all, we
do progress. And this time we can blunder with no more
effort than is required to push a button. It might be argued,
then, that it is extremely unimportant to ponder
about the sort of things that will be written in this postwar
world—escapist or realist. But that one may predict,
in the face of this reality, an escape from realism seems at
once probable and inevitable—and there are certain indications
that seem to favor the inevitable.</p>

<p>Superficially we might consider that a number of critics
and writers have remarked upon certain similarities between
the late Forties and the early Twenties. And, so linked have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
the two decades become, a mere mention of the Twenties
leads inevitably to a rediscovery of the Nineties. The Modern
Library, which was more than just a publishing venture
in the 1920’s, began its series of reprints with Oscar
Wilde’s <i>Dorian Gray</i>. One of the first in a recent cycle of
films developed about psychological themes was a somewhat
sinister version of <i>Dorian Gray</i>. A recent theatrical
season featured simultaneous presentations of a play
about the Twenties and of several about the Nineties. Indeed,
<i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>—a likely title
that!—gave fashion its first really fashionable color since
before the war. Yellow, said a foremost fashion magazine
was <i>The Color</i>. To be sure, these are only superficial similarities.
That Wilde was revived in the Twenties and in the
late Forties is a manifestation without much meaning in
itself. That Yellow became a favorite color of the season
was perhaps no more than a reaction to our khaki consciousness
of the war years ... but there were other, and
more significant, indications.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>There have been, this past year or so, a number of
articles appearing in various literary journals, and even of
late in the more popular magazines, the burden of which
seems to be something between a call for a new estimate
of literature and a prediction that such an estimate is in
the making. Certainly the recent years, during which more
books were read by more people than at any time in history,
have given practicing writers the wider audience they
had, for centuries dreamed about. The writers for small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
cliques have had every opportunity to expand their cliques.
The writers for the masses had such a market as even the
most popular of them had never imagined. The Big Names
ran to bigger printings than even a publisher had dreamed
of. That we were in the midst of an almost world wide
paper shortage seemed at least the most obvious result of
this promiscuous reading and writing. But what have been
its literary effects?</p>

<p>Have the realists gained in favor as they predicted,
and had been predicting for years, that they would? Have
the proletarian novelists grown in stature now that, at long
last, the proletariat were not only reading but buying
books? Have the multitudinous novels about the Common
Man, the Little Man, the Man in the Street, been widely
accepted by the Common Man, the Little Man, the Man in
the Street? In this, the Century of the Common Man, such
a conclusion would seem to have been foregone. The writers
for the Common Man, spurred on by the foregone-ness
of their conclusions, became commoner and commoner—but
the Common Man began to show that he had developed
a few rather uncommon tastes indeed. Aside from
the comic books, which he consumed by the shipload (and
they can scarcely be called realistic), he has done all sorts
of queer things. He has granted the greatest gift in his
power, sales running to a million or more, to a book about
a lady and an egg, and to a group of the most outrageously
escapists novels that have ever cluttered up a publisher’s
list. Historical novels which were neither good history nor
good novels, became the new opium of the masses. Lusty
rogues and busty wenches went through their amorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
routine with a dream of empire in their roving eyes. The
Common Man went in heavily for mediaeval glamour and
colonial swashbuckling. This may be explained on the always
convenient grounds that the popular taste is lamentably
lacking in it.</p>

<p>What about the intellectuals? They have shown a remarkable
predilection for mystery novels with overtones of
Kraft-Ebing and undertones of Freud. The “psychological”
novel has enjoyed a vogue on a grand scale, and most
popular novelists have had a shot at it themselves. Several
novelists of a generation or two ago have been revived.
Henry James has been the subject of half a dozen serious
studies and most of his novels, the less boring ones, have
been republished, re-reviewed and hailed as masterpieces
by the Sunday reviewers. Trollope, too, has undergone the
full treatment. The 1920’s have been rediscovered once
again, this time complete with cartoons and photographs.
We may anticipate that Charles Dickens will shortly become
the subject of an intense and enthusiastic revival.</p>

<p>The <i>Saturday Review</i> has called for new gods. <i>Life</i>
magazine demands to know whether or not fiction has a
future, thinks not. The ladies’ fashion magazines, progressing
rapidly in the opposite direction, present a gallery of
“Significant writers” with photographs only slightly less
rococo than their elegantly gowned caryatids, including
one precious young fellow in a checkered weskit and the
most engaging bangs.</p>

<p>In short, the Little Man, having digested an overdose
of reading matter, seems about to form certain dietary
preferences, and they are not going to be along the anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
lines. Now this is not to be greatly wondered at. In
any period of intense literary activity (and we must use
the term very loosely), when, in short, “publishers will put
covers on almost anything,” two things are bound to happen.
The more popular novels set new records for sales
and for bad writing. New writers are rushed into print before
they’ve bothered to become good, and old established
writers are tempted and inevitably, invariably and immediately
succumb to the lure of mass sales. They are tricked
into competing on the commonest possible grounds with
the homesteaders. The more intellectual writers from their
peaks in Darien gaze down upon ever widening horizons
and find it difficult to focus upon anything of significance.
They, too, are tricked into deserting their small, comfortable
cliques and finally, after preliminary castings about,
fall back upon the reliable old revival, or they hail with
delirious delight some new master. Then, when this stage
has been reached, a reaction sets in.</p>

<p>The awesome sight of so very many bad novels shocks
even those who had succeeded in shocking themselves into
insensibility. The critics are appalled by the flood they have
helped to loose and, while waiting for the waters to abate,
they keep themselves dry and in fairly good spirits by
chanting a litany composed of the names of Tolstoy, Zola,
Dostoievski, Gorki, Swift, Proust, Stendahl and a number
of traditional but largely unreadable masters. Now and
again they discover a sort of Cardiff Giant and exhibit it
reverently to the masses. Books are written, critical studies
composed, translations arranged for, editions planned.
Critics, scholars, publishers and others solemnly take part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
in the usual ceremonies attendant upon the presentation of
a new writer named, let us say, Smerv.</p>

<p>Alois Smerv is, or was, a Montenegran mystic. Comparatively
little is known about his work, most of it has
never been published, none of it can be readily understood.
Nevertheless his name finds its way into practically every
review devoted to anything but juveniles. Smerv seems to
have been obsessed by most of the commoner manifestations
made famous by various Viennese psycho-analysts.
It is said that his books, had they ever been published,
would have attracted the unfavorable attention of the fascist
authorities and would undoubtedly have resulted in his expulsion
from his homeland or his installation in a concentration
camp. This, of course, is pure supposition, all that
we know for certain is that Smerv died of acute myopia in
1942 in an obscure town in the Balkans. His note books,
scrap books, ration books and a mess of mss. found their
way into the sympathetic hands of an international litterateur—with
the inevitable result. This, then, is one of our
latest literary idols.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>And now we come to the point of conceding that
Arthur Machen is not and never has been a “naturalist,”
that is, he has never written in the manner which we have
come to call naturalism or realism. A great deal of modern
American and English fiction over the past forty or fifty
odd years has been of this sort. It stemmed, following one
of the periodical Anglo-Saxon reversions to the Gallic, from
Zola, the father of naturalism. One need hardly wonder
what Machen might say today of naturalism and Zola, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
said it some fifty years ago in <i>Hieroglyphics</i> and again in
<i>The Secret Glory</i>. And Machen was saying <i>then</i> a great
many of the things the critics of today are just beginning
to discover.</p>

<p>To take an excellent example; we have the case of
one of our best known and most highly regarded novelists;
one whose realism has begun to transcend reality so much
that his last book has been called an allegory. His characters
are so super-real as to be almost “arch types,” and
they may eventually come to be regarded, unless they are
entirely lost in the shifting of values, as sketches worthy
to stand in a Dickensian gallery along with Micawber and
Pickwick.</p>

<p>For this is assuredly the direction of our drift—we are
not only turning away from naturalism and realism, we
are beginning to wonder why we ever turned to them at all.
For literature as a removal from the common life, or art
as an interpretation rather than a portrayal of life, has
little to do with either naturalism or realism. It may be
that, within this very decade, we will decide that the whole
trend of the past thirty or forty years has been up a dead-end
street inhabited by the dead-end kids of the literary
world, whose greatest talent was to shock each other with
the words they chalked up on the walls and fences of their
realistic little slum.</p>

<p>It has become increasingly obvious, even to the more
advanced critics, that there had come to exist but a very
narrow line between the realistic-naturalistic novel and
the journalism of the day. Not so long ago it was considered
the highest praise to call a novel “a significant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
social document.” Now it is becoming more fashionable to
refer to a novel as a rather poor novel <i>as</i> a novel, <i>but</i> a
significant social document. We are, it would seem, about
half-way round the circle. Mr. Sinclair Lewis wrote a book
a year or two ago which is also a case in point. Although
the critics were unanimous in pointing out that it was a
very bad novel, they admitted that it was significant. So
too, the flood of books about alcoholism, insanity, race
prejudice and other social problems. Most of these books
defy honest criticism on almost any grounds, since almost
everyone is more or less opposed to the same things these
books are against.</p>

<p>Of course these problems do exist, and they are urgent
problems indeed; but they do not necessarily constitute
the stuff of great or even good literature. Nor should the
importance of the problem automatically confer importance
or significance upon any writer, good, bad or indifferent,
who chooses to deal with it. Today’s tabloid may be as raw a
slice of life as today’s top ranking best seller—but no one
calls it literature. As for the revolt against “the genteel tradition,”
it was a natural reaction against stuffiness, Victorian
morality and overly “nice” novels—but the course taken by
those who rebelled against these things was not necessarily
the right one. It was, or soon became, quite as stuffy and even
more unreal. Still, there is much to be said on the subject,
for realism, by which we <i>can</i> mean honesty, cannot be, and
should not be, eliminated entirely as a literary force.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Dickens, that eminent Victorian,
was not a realist or that he was not realistic. No Hemingway
he, to be sure, but still, no Harold Bell Wright. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
can we say of many a writer relegated to oblivion by the
realists that they were not realistic. John Galsworthy wrote
as realistically of the upper-middle classes as John Steinbeck
writes of paisanos—and Soames Forsyte is as much a
person, a <i>real</i> person, as the youth with the acne. Now
this is a very close to the heart of the matter, for the realists,
and the naturalists, have claimed that writers like Galsworthy
are not realists—and of course their point would
be that Galsworthy wrote of Soames Forsyte and Steinbeck
wrote of bums and vagrants, of the dispossessed and the
youth with the acne.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that they quarreled rather with
Soames than with Galsworthy—that Soames was, for some
reason or other, less real than, for example, an earnest
young picket-line marcher. Indeed, it has been almost a
prime principle, that the realists write of the so-called
“underprivileged,” and all that was needed to earn a reputation
for a book was a fairly accurate portrayal of life in
the less-desirable quarters of any city or town. If a few
scenes of drunken quarrels, beatings by cops (classically
called Cossacks) and tableaux in which oppressed mill-workers
were being violently oppressed, so much the better.
Of course not all realists wrote exclusively about the underprivileged.
Many wrote of the upper classes, for this was
considered realism too—but only if the upper classes were
portrayed in an unfavorable light. So it becomes apparent
that almost the whole of realism has been a social rather
than a literary movement. For a time, and under special
conditions, this seemed reasonable enough, but there are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
indications that it is in the process of being rejected as the
only literary criterion.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Of the novelists whose names have formed a sort of
literary litany this past decade or two: Hemingway, Dos
Passos, Farrell, Faulkner, Caldwell and Steinbeck—the work
of Steinbeck offers most in the way of material for analysis
according to the lights of both realists and romanticists.
For Steinbeck has been hailed as a great realist, and it was
he who first seems to have transcended reality, and certainly
he comes closest to approaching the “removal from
the common life” postulated by Machen as the prime
requisite for the creative writer. <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> was
and is a wonderful book—as great a piece of journalism
as has been produced in an age that specializes in that
peculiar literary form—the documentary; and it was saved
from being mere competent journalism, or even inspired
journalism, by characterization alone. Here again we must
look to Machen for, if not a direct reference to Steinbeck,
at least an applicable parallel.</p>

<p>For Steinbeck’s characters, the Joads, the Paisanos, the
Hermit with his dogs, the bums in <i>Cannery Row</i>—these are
all figures of such proportion and created in such a perspective
as that described by Machen in his essay on
Dickens. Machen points out that Dickens was a symbolist
... no such persons as Pickwick or Micawber ever walked
the earth. “They are creatures,” says Machen, “of the world
of vision, of that other world which is beside us always,
which transcends the sight of unpurged eyes.” And then
Machen goes on to define the “true realist” as one who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
symbolizes “by means of phenomena, eternal verities.”</p>

<p>This deftness of Steinbeck’s in drawing portraits has
led him into trouble with his devoted critics for whom,
apparently, realism can be carried to extremes. A case in
point is the Colonel in <i>The Moon is Down</i>. This German,
if not Nazi, officer, it will be recalled, was quite a controversial
figure back in the war days when the book was
published. Now the Colonel had every right, actually and
literarily, whether as an actual person or an imagined one,
to act as he did. It may have been a none too happy
choice for Steinbeck—he could have given us the Eric Von
Stroheim figure we all expected of him, but he gave us
instead the Major Stanhope type. This was not a very popular
choice with the ardent and articulate admirers of Mr.
Steinbeck’s realism.</p>

<p>Then there was the matter of <i>Lifeboat</i>, a motion picture
shown during the war. Mr. Steinbeck did the script,
or worked on it, or did whatever it is established writers
do in Hollywood. At any rate Steinbeck was taken to task
by at least one film critic and not a few columnists who
stepped out of their roles long enough to have a look at
the films. The story, a Hitchcock natural, involved a group
of people thrown together in a lifeboat. Among the group
was a German submarine officer—perhaps the Captain. The
thing that angered the erstwhile admirers, confounded the
critics and dismayed the defenders of Democracy, was that
the German was portrayed as the most capable man aboard
the lifeboat. Not only did he show qualities of leadership
which were found to be detestably proficient, but other
members of the crew, all Allies of one sort or another, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
shown to be a confused and sometimes cowardly lot. This
outrageous invention by a man with a reputation for realism
upset the critics and the columnists. No less an authority
than the American Sybil cried out against the
extravagance of the invention in which an officer and a
seaman was permitted to exercise both authority and seamanship.
Of course most of these outcries may be attributed
to the fact that we were then at war with both the confoundedly
charming Colonel and the confoundedly capable
Captain.</p>

<p>Nevertheless everyone breathed easier when <i>Cannery
Row</i> was announced as a return to the “early Steinbeck”
even though, by this time, realists everywhere had become
aware of a chink in the armor, and the left-wing critics
took a decidedly dim view of the light-hearted way in which
Steinbeck’s social outcasts took their social ostracism.</p>

<p>When <i>The Wayward Bus</i> rattled onto the literary scene
the critics scanned the faces of the passengers as eagerly
as relatives waiting at the depot. Sure enough—there were
cries of recognition from several groups. One crowd hailed
the youth with the acne—Johnny had come marching home
again to swell the ranks of the realists. Others, remembering
the Colonel and the Captain, recognized at least a lineal
descendant in the girl who sat in wine glasses. She was,
for a girl who sat in wine glasses, sufficiently incredible to
belong to the gallery of allegorical figures set up for the
specific purpose of puzzling the proletarians. And so the
bus pulled in with apparently the right character for almost
everyone waiting at the depot.</p>

<p>This somewhat didactic digression, while it seems to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
have no direct bearing upon either Arthur Machen or his
works, is offered in explanation of some of the theories
expressed in <i>Hieroglyphics</i>—under the subtitle, if you wish,
of <i>The Ultimate Fate of a Realist</i>.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>We have arrived at a point in our literary history (or,
if you prefer, our social progress, our ideological advancement,
our cultural development) when there is need for a
new estimate of the task and aims of our modern literature
or at least the re-establishment of certain values and standards
previously set aside.</p>

<p>We must once again divorce literature from life, if by
that we will understand that literature is not, and never
was supposed to be, a mirror held up before our common
life. We must discard the so-called “true-to-life” standard
by which our critical attitudes have been governed for so
many years. Above all, we must renounce the propaganda
psychosis, and we must admit that even good propaganda
is never literature and that even great literature is seldom
propaganda. We have those, of course, who will rise to
point out that such and such a book or novel or play was
excellent propaganda for such and such a cause or event.
To which we may answer: it was not so conceived. For
the glibness with which the word propaganda is used is
rivalled only by the glibness of the propagandists themselves.
To make a case for any work of literature as a bit
of effective propaganda for any cause is to distort and debase
the purpose for which it was created.</p>

<p>There is much too much to do with literature today<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
that has nothing to do with literature at all. We must learn
again that the weavers of fantasy are, after all, the veritable
realists. For it must be admitted that we have at hand ample
evidence that this is so.</p>

<p>There is realism in great literature, but realism alone
does not make great literature. The writer, or observer, who
sees an event or an occurrence, however rare or moving an
event it may be, who is moved to write about it merely to
describe, with minute realism, what he had observed is no
more creating literature than the earnest New Englander
who writes to the Times or the Globe to report the first
robin. But Arthur Machen has said these things before—and
said them better.</p>

<p>You will find, in the closing pages of <i>Hieroglyphics</i>,
this passage, which seems an excellent closing passage for
this digressive chapter:</p>

<p>“Have you noticed how many of the greatest writers,
so far from desiring that compliment of ‘fidelity to life,’ do
their best to get away from life, to make their books, in
ordinary phraseology, ‘unreal.’ I do not know whether anybody
has compared the facts before or made the only possible
inference from them; but you remember how Rabelais
professes to derive his book from a little mouldy manuscript,
found in a tomb, how Cervantes beginning to <i>propria
persona authoris</i>, breaks off and discovers the true history
of <i>Don Quixote</i> in the Arabic Manuscript of Cid
Hamet Benengeli, how Hawthorne prologizes with the custom-house
at Salem, and lights, in an old lumber-room, on
the documents telling him the story of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>.
<i>Pickwick</i> was the transcript of the ‘Transactions’ or ‘Papers’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
of the Pickwick Club, and Tennyson’s <i>Morte d’Arthur</i> shelters
itself, in the same way, behind the personality of an
imaginary writer. There is a very profound significance in
all this, and you find a trace of the same instinct in the
Greek Tragedies, where the final scene, the peripeteia, is
not shown on the stage, but described by a ‘messenger.’
The fact is that the true artist, so far from being the imitator
of life, endures some of his severest struggles in endeavoring
to get away from life, and until he can do this
he knows that his labor is all in vain.”</p>

<p>The original outline for this book included a chapter
to be called “Hieroglyphics.” This was to be composed
largely of what other writers had said or written about
Arthur Machen. It seemed a good title and a sound enough
notion, and certainly there has been enough said and written
about Machen to compose a fine chapter indeed.</p>

<p>And then it occurred to me that there was a rather
cynical note being struck here, that the use of that particular
word in such a connection might imply (and I am quite
sure that at one time it was meant to imply) a certain lack
of respect for some of the material to be grouped under
that heading. Much has been written about Machen, not as
much, certainly, as one would like to see; and some of it,
unfortunately, is the sort of thing with which one cannot
agree. As, for example, the views of the anonymous Manchester
guardian, the reviews of some of the early books as
they appeared in London newspapers, and the estimates of
Miss Dorothy Scarborough in her otherwise excellent book
about the supernatural elements in English literature.</p>

<p>On the other hand: one cannot always agree with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
idolizers and the cultists. These are, at times, even more
annoying and sometimes rather embarrassing.</p>

<p>The admirers of Arthur Machen are probably as heterogeneous
a collection as one is likely to find anywhere outside
the membership lists of the Book of the Month Club, the
Literary Guild and a distinguished After Shave Club. There
are, among the more ardent Arthurians, poets and pedants,
dilettantes and divorcees, men of letters and three-letter men
from the universities, reviewers and romanticists, critics and
connoisseurs, columnists and collectors of every description—a
rare assemblage that numbers sincere admirers,
warm friends, not a few dreads and some drolls. Mr.
Machen’s works are known to the Librarians at Yale and
at Stanford. They are known also to the librarians at Liggetts
and Walgrens—for recently several anthologies have
appeared on the forty-nine cent table and several Machen
stories have made the grade in the corner drug store through
the medium of the quarter pocketbooks. This is passing
strange company for a man whose first editions were published
in Vigo Street under the Sign of the Bodley Head
and whose American triumphs were under the auspices of
the aristocratic Borzoi.</p>

<p>Mr. Machen’s published works have fared as variously.
His stories have appeared in anthologies whose sales have
run into thousands, and there is noted in Van Patten’s
bibliography a small work published in an edition of two
copies.</p>

<p>How does one decide upon an edition of two copies?
It must be admitted that, to his fervent admirers at least,
the peddling of Machen to the millions along with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
malteds and lunches at Liggetts is to be preferred to the
arch-conservativeness that confines a Machen item to a very
limited edition of two copies. It may cause shudders to run
up and down the arthritic vertebrae of many a venerable
Machenite to suggest such a thing, but I find myself wishing
that Winchell would one day give Machen “the works.”
And who knows but that he may? With realism and the
realists in disorder, if not retreat, in disarray if not utter
rout, with realism seen from a rapidly shifting focal point,
with reviewers suggesting that the work and the world of
our realists may be, after all, allegory—who knows but the
Sunday Night Sage may not admonish Americans from
coast to coast to demand from their bookseller a copy of
<i>Dog and Duck</i>, or the <i>Anatomy of Tobacco</i> (LSMFT) or
even <i>Hieroglyphics</i>?</p>

<p>Such unscholarly suggestions may seem unworthy, may
even draw the fire of many Machenites who will deeply
resent such facetious flippancy—but they are offered merely
as an antidote to the equally absurd and equally unworthy
tactics of some collectors who come to praise and to bury
Machen in the same devout breath.</p>

<p>I must confess that, while I envy certain men and
mausoleums the possession of many a Machen item, I am
pleased beyond measure to find <i>The Great God Pan</i> or <i>The
Cosy Room</i> or <i>The Novel of the White Powder</i> in the
gaudiest, grizzliest anthology of horror stories displayed for
the delight of the drug store trade.</p>

<p>However, to return to the Arthurians, whether of the
cultivated or the common garden variety. The response to
a prospectus describing this volume when it was in its projected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
state was enlightening. There were letters on fine
paper bearing the crests of famous colleges and libraries,
there were scribbled notes from, obviously, “stfans” in
Kansas City, Dallas, Scranton and the Coast. These letters
did affect the construction of this book in one important
respect. I determined then to add to the book a bibliography
that would direct the reader of Machen to the stories and
essays of Machen wherever they may be found. The scholars
and the specialists know in which vaults the more valuable
manuscripts are under lock and key. Let them rest in peace.
One day, perhaps, they will be released and they will be
read as it was intended, by the man who wrote them, that
they should be. Meanwhile it may be amusing to compile
a list of the unlikely and out of the way corners of literature
in which there are mentions of Machen—and to the
true Machenite the mere mention of Machen is rewarding.</p>

<p>We’ve wandered from Wilde to Winchell, but there
are many more unexpected encounters awaiting the ardent
Arthurian. For example, Tiffany Thayer, <i>enfant terrible</i> of
the late Twenties and early Thirties, whose books were
rather lurid things, made use of Machen in certain passages.
We find, if we dredge deep enough, a passing reference to
Machen, and one that might conceivably outrage the true
believer.</p>

<p>An even more strange, and not too flattering, reference
is found in one of the books of William Seabrooke. Mr.
Seabrooke, who visited strange places and saw strange
things, once visited, as a client, and I violate no confidence,
an asylum. Since Mr. Seabrooke wrote a book about his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
experiences therein, any hesitation on my part would be a
needless delicacy.</p>

<p>Mr. Seabrooke’s mention of Machen is even given a
title: Self-Portrait of a Dementia Praecox Case on First
Reading the works of Machen. The “self-portrait” follows:
“Sweet spirits of my own dementia praecox! womb-wailing
guide calls reechoing throughout sub-cavernousterraneous!
fuga, fugae. Corncopios fugalations in depths arbeitung
verstaltheight.... I have just read <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>!
By the brazen buttocks of that brimstone bellona who lolls
in lakes of lava, never in my life have I read or even imagined
that such a piece of escapist literature existed. He is
superior to Dunsany and to Algernon Blackwood who
though almost not an escapist may be classed with them.
The book is filled with black magic. The man’s powers of
psychotic invention are almost unbelievable and his familiarity
with certain phenomena of abnormal psychology is
creepy. Are you acquainted with Tchaikovski’s scherzi?
especially the waltz-scherzo of his Fifth? It moves in this
same weird, uncanny way. Now I wish I were dead....”</p>

<p>Seabrooke’s d.p. exhibits astonishing lucidity toward
the end, is apparently versed in intellectual small talk, and
displays a familiarity with the works of James Joyce as well.</p>

<p>It is sometimes fascinating to compare different reactions
to certain of Machen’s tales. Basil Davenport writing
in the <i>Saturday Review</i> some years ago noted: “... there
are some stories which portray a non-moral fall into a
moral gulf; someone’s foot quite innocently slips, and
there is no stopping above the bottom of hell ... that
is what makes Mr. Arthur Machen’s stories supreme of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
their kind ... and such a story of irrational, irresistible
temptation as Mr. Machen’s <i>The White People</i> ... about
a little girl whose nurse happens to be a witch, and who
becomes a devil-worshipper without the least idea of what
she is doing.” Carl Van Vechten says of this same story:
“Was ever a more malignantly depraved story written than
<i>The White People</i> (which it might be profitable to compare
with Henry James’s <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>?).”</p>

<p>Mr. Carl Van Vechten’s <i>Peter Whiffle</i> probably did as
much to popularize Arthur Machen in the Twenties as any
score of reviewers, but it also had the effect of rarifying
Machen and conditioning him for a specific audience. It
was Mr. Van Vechten’s (or rather, Peter’s) audience more
than it was Machen’s. It was this audience, I think, that
prompted Walter Winchell to report, breathlessly, that
Arthur Machen was “tops among the literati.” Peter was a
delightfully “naughty” character—there were so many of
them in the Twenties! When he spoke of Machen he was
speaking mostly about Peter. Nevertheless he was an able
press agent. Said Peter, in part, and to paraphrase a phrase,
we quote:</p>

<p>“It is a byword of the day that one only takes from a
work of art what one brings to it, and how few readers
can bring to Machen the requisite qualities, how few readers
have gnosis! Machen evokes beauty out of horror,
mystery and terror. He suggests the extremes of the terrible,
the vicious, the most evil, by never describing them.
His very reserve conveys the infinity of abomination....
But his expression soars so high, there is such ecstasy in
his prose, that we are not meanly thrilled or revolted by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
necromancy; rather we are uplifted and exalted by his suggestion
of impurity and corruption, which leads us to
ponder over the mysterious connection between man’s religious
and sensual natures.” From this point on Peter’s
bizarre rhapsody over Machen includes references to so
many Florentine painters, Arabian necromancers, Asiatic
messiahs and French Symbolistes that the average Machenite
loses sight of his idol in the confusing blaze of intellectual
pyrotechnics.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>And then we have the testimony of C. Lewis Hind, a
sort of literary journalist who once saw Machen plain.
Mr. Hind did essays and sketches of literary people about
London and collected them into books called <i>Authors and I</i>
and <i>More Authors and I</i>. He remembers having met Machen
once at a dinner given for Sir Frank Benson and members
of his Shakespearean Repertoire Company; he also recalls
having seen Machen “slouching through the interminable
corridors of the Evening News.”</p>

<p>An article on Machen, published in one of his collections,
he credits to a letter from Vincent Starrett. Mr.
Starrett’s enthusiasm apparently moved Hind to do a piece
on Mr. Machen. The encounter described in the article
was, apparently, a chance encounter of the sort in which
Machen himself delighted.</p>

<p>Mr. Hind had gone, one evening, to call upon an
acquaintance who lived in one of the London Inns of
Court. While he was peering at the names inscribed on
the oak door the door was opened—by Arthur Machen!
“My friend was not in, but the author of <i>Hieroglyphics</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
and I had some good, rapid talk. He is an admirable monologist
when in the mood (see <i>Hieroglyphics</i>). For some
reason or other I have a vivid recollection of that brief
encounter—the open door, the snug room beyond, the
books and a lamp, warmth and stillness, and Arthur Machen
standing in the passage—smiling and talking, ready to talk
but also ready to go back to his folios.”</p>

<p>Machen was, according to Mr. Hind, “a heavily built
man, with a large genial, yet brooding, clean-shaven face;
a good companion, I think, but one who keeps many of his
thoughts to himself.” Mr. Hind was, in short, charmed and
impressed, but he obviously did not consider Arthur
Machen a V.I.P. It would be interesting to read Machen
on Hind.</p>

<p>One of the most curious estimates of Machen is made
by Professor Cornelius Weygandt in his <i>A Century of the
English Novel</i>. Professor Weygandt admires Machen somewhat
for his essays, and classifies him as a “lesser late
Victorian” along with Baring-Gould, Quiller-Couch, Marie
Corelli, Mrs. Humphrey Ward, Rider Haggard, Rudyard
Kipling, Walter Pater and others—a very curious group
indeed!</p>

<p>The professor devotes a full page to Machen, which
is not at all bad, and well above the average, for lesser
late Victorians! Machen’s great fault, the professor finds,
is that he is not a story-teller, he has not taught himself
the craft. He has little sense of the creation of character
and his own life is, obviously, very narrow. As an essayist,
however, concedes the Professor, Machen is often a bringer
of delight. <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>, on the other hand, is saved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
from futility only by some good writing. So sayeth Professor
Weygandt.</p>

<p>Wagenknecht, in his <i>Cavalcade of the English Novel</i>,
is much more to my taste than the austere professor. He
introduces Machen as “one of the most remarkable examples
of sustained devotion to creative work in literary history.”
He finds that Machen reveals a gift for breathless
narrative to match LeFanu’s, but he feels that this quality
is lacking in the book generally regarded as Machen’s
masterpiece—<i>The Hill of Dreams</i>. Nevertheless, Wagenknecht
considers Machen “important,” he rates him with
Blackwood and de la Mare, and has included Machen’s
<i>The Terror</i> in his collection <i>Six Novels of the Supernatural</i>
published a few years ago by Viking.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The student of Machen is not content to have read
everything Machen has ever written (and there are few who
have), he must also read everything that has ever been written
about Arthur Machen. He may begin, naturally enough,
with a study of the period in which Machen first appears.
There have been quite a few books written about the Nineties,
these unaccountably yield but little material on Machen.
Richard LeGallienne, Holbrook Jackson and Osburt Burdett,
whose studies of that period are very carefully written and
copiously annotated, scarcely mention Machen at all.</p>

<p>One then moves on to memoirs and biographies of
the men who lived and wrote in this period, and even consults
the critical studies on the whole vast subject of English
literature. One picks up dozens of such books and soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
develops the habit of examining them from the back cover
forward, for a glance at the index reveals whether the book
is worth while, from this viewpoint, or not. Too often one
finds mention of Macaulay, Lord; MacCarthy, Desmond;
MacLeod, Fiona; even Mackenzie, Compton—but few are
the mentions of Machen.</p>

<p>One finds too that the index of a book can be a very
revealing thing indeed. We have before us, for example,
the memoirs of a Literary Figure of, let us say, the 1890’s
and the early 1900’s. The index indicates that our man
knew everyone worth knowing. We find Shaw and More,
Shelley and Kelley, Shakespeare, Rossetti and Donne, Keats
and Yeats, Whistler and Wilde, Moore and Hardy and a
generous sprinkling of the nobility. It would seem, from
the index, that our man lived a very full and eventful life,
that he was close, as they say, to the heart of things.</p>

<p>The book itself is rather likely to be pretty dull stuff—mostly
about our man’s preoccupation with his public school
and his dislike of games, the amazing and discouraging
tenacity with which his great aunt in Bath clung to life,
the duplicity of publishers and the simply astonishing
things that can and do befall an Englishman in Naples,
Nice or Florence. Throughout the book, however, one encounters
reports of what Whistler said to Pennell or Pater
or both; what G.B.S. wrote to the brash American journalist
and how Lord Lymph responded to a quip tossed out by
Lord Lissom. Hence the index. One can only conclude that
reviewers, and possibly publishers, read the index more carefully
than the book itself.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, the slow unrewarding progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
through the shelves of the public library does yield a choice
bit or two and these, be it noted, more frequently in books
by Americans than by Englishmen.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant Richards who wrote in 1895 to Arthur
Machen asking if he had anything he would care to have
published, has written at least two books of his experiences
as one of England’s most enterprising publishers. Neither
of them contained a single mention of Arthur Machen
although Richards published several of Machen’s books,
and at a time when Machen’s name was certainly an asset
to any publisher’s list.</p>

<p>The index of Richards’ book about A. E. Housman
(Oxford, 1942) arouses hope. There are three references
to Machen. The first of these is contained in a letter from
Housman to Richards. The context, in full, follows: “I
don’t think Machen ought to drink port on the top of
Burgundy.” One may wonder, one is tantalized, by the
implications of that brief note. Does it imply that Machen
did drink port on top of Burgundy—or that he merely contemplated
doing so or sought advice on the advisability. If
he did, were the results memorable, and in what respect?
Does it imply that Housman is a purist in these matters?
A Tory in tippling? Does it hint at “an incident”?</p>

<p>Another reference is even more brief and profoundly
unimportant. “We know too that Housman read Arthur
Machen and Frederick Baron Corvo.” The most significant
entry is this, from another Housman letter: “Thanks to
you, I believe I possess Machen’s complete works. He is
always interesting (except in the <i>Evening News</i>) and to
some extent good. Mixing up religion and sexuality is not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
thing I am fond of, and in this book the Welsh element
rather annoys me. The imitation of Rabelais is very clever.”</p>

<p>We know, at any rate, that Housman read Machen,
quite a bit of him. He was not fond of the Welsh, nor
of mixing religion and sexuality nor, for that matter, of
mixing port and burgundy.</p>

<p>What we would like most to know from Mr. Richards,
I think, is why it took him ten years to change his mind
about <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>, and why he changed it when
he did. Of this, unfortunately, we have no hint.</p>

<p>The Machen revival of the Twenties lasted through to
the end of the decade and, to some, to the end of an era.
Machen appeared at rare intervals in public life, preferring
the countryside of Wales and the company of his friends,
a great many of them Americans. Paul Jordan-Smith and
Robert Hillyer and Montgomery Evans have given us
sketches of Machen through this period. For the most part,
however, his work was done. In the early Thirties Machen
wrote a novel, <i>The Green Round</i>. It has not yet been published
in this country nor is it very well known. Machen
says it is “sorry stuff.” As for <i>Tom O’Bedlam</i>, it was an
essay “written to order of an American.” Machen never
saw the book in print.</p>

<p>In 1936 there was a brief revival of interest in Machen
occasioned by the publication of two collections of his
stories and essays. Hutchinson brought out <i>The Children
of the Pool</i> in which there appeared seven stories not previously
collected. Rich and Cowan brought out a collection
called <i>The Cosy Room</i>, consisting of essays and stories
collected over a period from the late 1880’s to the late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
1920’s. Each of the pieces included in this collection is
given a date—apparently the year in which it was written.
Some of the dates supplied, presumably by Machen, give
rise to bibliographical speculation. Most of these pieces
had been published elsewhere although some of them, obviously
“the wreckage of discarded and abandoned books,”
appeared in print for the first time.</p>

<p>The dust-jacket of Hutchinson’s <i>Children of the Pool</i>
carried an “Appreciation” of Machen, one of the finest
and most admirable I have ever encountered. To find it on,
of all places, a dust-jacket! This is no publisher’s blurb but
an analysis that deserves to be included in this or any book
about Machen. The author of the following tribute is unknown,
to me at least: “Mr. Machen creates his own world.
This world is a fusion of the world that is accepted in
every day reality—in which events and their causes are explicable
by traditional and humdrum interpretations—and
one that is distinguished not only by the weird and extraordinary
effects. The author does not try to present a state
of affairs so topsy-turvy and bizarre that you are intrigued
merely by its very madness. The supernatural insinuates
itself subtly into these stories. They have an air of common
reality until the author develops their mystical undercurrents.
And in this blending Mr. Machen’s art is supreme.
It has an infinite capacity for producing what E. J. O’Brien
describes as “a willing suspension of disbelief” [<i>this fine
phrase has also been attributed to Dr. Canby, Bennet Cerf
and, of course, Samuel Taylor Coleridge</i>]. That Mr. Machen’s
faculty in this direction can extend beyond the circle of sympathetic
readers and convince masses has been proved by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
fact that his imaginative treatment of a very famous occasion
was accepted by thousands of men and women as literal
description. These stories offer varied excursions into realms
simultaneously unfathomable and alluring, and on that account
alone they are memorable. But there is also Mr.
Machen’s craftsmanship, and his style which is a delight to
read. A character in the book says: ‘A man must know the
grammar of his business, whatever it is; the rest, if it is to be
the first order, must be the work of the hidden flame within.’”</p>

<p>Now and then Machen did an introduction or preface
for a book or collection, none of them are of particular
importance as Machen “items.” In 1937 Hutchinson brought
out Philip Sergeant’s <i>Witches and Warlocks</i> with a preface
by Machen. The book was, according to the publisher, suggested
to Sergeant by his old friend Arthur Machen. In
his introduction Machen quotes some of the theories expressed
in <i>The White People</i> and <i>The Great God Pan</i>. He
hints, in other words, and in justification of his friend’s
labours, that there are more things in heaven and earth
than mere hawks and handsaws.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>In the years since the publication of the “yellow
books” by Knopf and the attendant enthusiasm for his
works, Arthur Machen has been very little in the public
eye. The Machen vogue of the 1920’s seemed to exhaust
itself almost as soon as the Knopf editions were exhausted.
The Caerleon Edition, published in 1923 by Seeker in London,
quickly disappeared, and we entered once again upon
a lengthy period of “neglect”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>Actually, Machen has not been as neglected as we
might suppose. It is true that he has not been accorded
the recognition that is his due, but there are hundreds,
possibly thousands, who have never neglected nor forgotten
Machen. The late Alfred Goldsmith, one of New York’s
most amiable booksellers, wrote me, a year or two ago,
that there is and always has been a constant, if small,
demand for his books. Ben Abramson of the famed Argus
Book Shop has his North Wall addicts who are always
eager for Machen items. August Derleth, the one-man
wonder of mid-western publishing circles, knows the value
of a Machen story in a collection issuing from Arkham
House. A new generation of booksellers on New York’s
Fourth Avenue know Machen by reputation, even though
many of them have never seen one of the eagerly sought-after
books.</p>

<p>Machen himself went into retirement some years ago.
For years there were gatherings at his home in St. John’s
Wood, gay parties attended by writers and theatrical people
and journalists—and Americans. Machen has always
had a tremendous appeal for Americans—possibly because
of our Hawthorne and Poe, and possibly because we managed
to avoid the stagy school of the Gothic novelists
which he so disliked. And Machen liked Americans, too,
as Robert Hillyer related in his <i>Atlantic</i> article. It pleased
Machen that the majority of the letters he received about
his works were from Americans. On one occasion he told
Hillyer he would consider it a compliment to be taken
“into the fold as a fellow American.”</p>

<p>Later, when Machen retired to Wales, there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
picnics on the cliffs overlooking the sea. Robert Hillyer
has given us an amusing account of one of these festive
occasions in his recent article on Machen. With the coming
of the war these visits were impossible, of course.
Montgomery Evans, late of the U. S. Army, member of the
Salmagundi Club and resident of Greenwich, was the last
of Machen’s visitors before the war.</p>

<p>Evans had known Machen since 1923. It was his
pleasant practice to give parties with the Machens on such
American occasions as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving.
These parties promoted Anglo-American understanding with
“American food and French wine” and such guests as
Augustus John, Holbrooke Jackson, Tommy Earp and
others. Evans happened to be again in England when
World War II broke out. Machen had written an introduction
for a book Evans was about to publish. Book and
introduction went to the bottom of the North Atlantic with
the torpedoed <i>Athenia</i> as Evans was bound for home when
the war was only a few days old.</p>

<p>Throughout the dark years of the war Machen corresponded
with his American friends—Evans, Jordan-Smith,
Goldsmith and others. These were unhappy days: Machen’s
health was poor, his eyesight was failing rapidly, his son
Hilary was in a German prison camp, letters were few and
far between and Machen too old to contrive legends as he
had done in the darker days of 1915.</p>

<p>After the war Machen was placed on the King’s List—the
result of a movement instituted largely through the
efforts of Montgomery Evans. In a letter to Robert Hillyer
Machen wrote: “Our gracious Sovereign, King George the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Fifth, out of his great bounty and kindness, has awarded
me a pension.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hillyer’s reflection at this news is worth repeating
here: “I had a vision of the fine old man in Bardic raiment,
receiving a bag of gold from a mediaeval monarch clad in
ermine and silks and with a golden crown on his head.”</p>

<p>Machen’s Street Fleet days were over now, he no
longer appeared, a Johnstonian figure, in the streets of
London, nor was he ever again to impersonate the great
Doctor in pageants. There were occasional articles in magazines
and one last book, <i>The Holy Terrors</i>, published in
1946.</p>

<p>With the close of the war, correspondence was resumed
on a more regular schedule. Machen was failing badly, his
eyesight was almost gone, his hand had lost its grace but
his letters were, as Montgomery Evans notes, “as charming
and Johnstonian as ever.” Hilary had been released from
the Germans and returned home. Scarcely had the family
been reunited at Amersham, however, when another blow
fell—Machen’s wife died. This “ample, easy-going, good
natured woman,” as Hillyer describes her, meant much to
Machen and their two children. She was, she must have
been, a woman of great understanding and of infinite patience.
She accepted poverty, hoping always for the recognition
she felt was her husband’s due. And of course she
knew, as well as he, that what he wrote might interest, at
most, comparatively few. After her death Machen declined
rapidly. His letters had to be written by his son, but the
mind that composed them was still that of “the greatest
master of English prose in our time.” Then, in the closing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
days of the year 1947, in a private hospital in Beaconsfield,
Arthur Machen died at the age of 84.</p>

<p>Machen’s passing was not unnoticed. <i>The New York
Times</i> (Dec. 16, 1947) printed his photograph and an
obituary under the heading: “Author of the Story That
Led to ‘Angel of Mons’ Legend Dies at 84—Won Success
at 60.” A few other papers in the country carried similar
stories—there were no bulletins, no eulogies by electronic
commentators. Subscribers to the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> probably
recalled Robert Hillyer’s article on Machen in the
May issue. Letters passed between friends expressing regret
for there were, as Nathan Van Patten wrote, “some
who mourn.”</p>

<p>Chief among these, perhaps, are the members of the
Arthur Machen Society. This Society was formed early in
the spring of 1948 by Nathan Van Patten, Vincent Starrett,
Paul Jordan-Smith, Carl Van Vechten, Montgomery
Evans, Robert Hillyer (all names that will long be associated
with Machen) as well as August Derleth, Joseph
Vodrey, Ben Abramson, James T. Babb, William P. Wreden,
Frederick Coykendall, Cyril Clemens, Gilbert Seldes,
Ashton Stevens and a score of comparative newcomers in
the great society of the admirers of Arthur Machen.</p>

<p>This is an informal group which hopes, in the words
of its president, Mr. Van Patten, to stimulate an interest
in Arthur Machen’s work. There is to be an exchange of
information and privately printed Machen material, with
possibly an annual or quarterly publication.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1948 Alfred Knopf issued <i>Tales of
Horror and the Supernatural</i>, the largest and the best collection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
of Machen’s stories ever published. Edited by Philip
Van Doren Stern, it included a reprint of Hillyer’s <i>Atlantic</i>
article. The book was reviewed with interest by Orville
Prescott and John Dickinson Carr in the <i>Times</i>. <i>The
Nation’s</i> reviewer thought the atmosphere of the tales did
not “compensate for his failure to explain the inexplicable.”
Mr. Knopf’s ad-men, applying modern techniques, exhorted
readers to “remember Machen, it rhymes with crackin’.”</p>

<p>The Arthur Machen Society has already begun to make
good its promise to stimulate interest in Arthur Machen:</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Kelly Vodrey of Canton, Ohio, a specialist
in Machen bibliography, has printed and distributed to the
members of the Society a booklet: <i>There Are Some Who
Mourn</i>, written by Nathan Van Patten.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Patten, a distinguished professor of bibliography
at Stanford University and dean of Machenites,
has printed a handsome booklet, limited to fifty copies, of
Arthur Machen’s <i>The Gray’s Inn Coffee House</i>.</p>

<p>There will be others. At long last something is being
done to right the wrongs of which Mr. Cabell wrote so
many years ago.</p>

<p>One might devote a great amount of time and give considerable
thought to the final pages of a book about Arthur
Machen. It is not easy for anyone who admires Machen to
leave off talking or writing about him.</p>

<p>This book was planned and begun while Arthur Machen
still lived. He knew of its creation, its aims and its purpose,
and he gave the book his “plenary blessings.” The
early chapters were sent in galley form to Amersham.
Machen read the proofs or, his sight failing badly, had
them read to him by his son Hilary. The proofs were returned
with a little note and sometimes with comments or
corrections written in the margins.</p>

<p>I have hoped many things for this book—that it would
arouse more interest in Machen, that it would bring about
a great revival of reading his books. He has been sadly
neglected as a writer, we all feel that, and yet Machen
writes: “I question whether what you call the neglect of
my work is due to any fault of publishers or public—the
real cause of it, I believe, is the fact that I have been
interested as a writer in a variety of things which only interest
a few people. This is a matter of individual constitution:
it is incurable.”</p>

<p>We who are incurable, and we are not few, can only
hope to interest many people in the variety of things about
which Arthur Machen wrote.</p>

<p>“<i>I am sure that Bibliography is a capital game,
but it is not my game.</i>”—<i>Arthur Machen</i></p>

<p>“<i>I don’t care two pence whether a book is in
the first edition or in the tenth, nay, if the tenth is
the best edition I would rather have it.</i>”—<i>Arthur Machen</i></p>

</div>

<p>A complete and comprehensive and correct bibliography
of the works of Arthur Machen would be a wondrous
work indeed. It would include such important matters as
colors of cloths and types of bindings, the number of pages
and the presence of prefaces and plates. It would, one
hopes, clearly indicate such dates as were of importance
and many other fascinating facts to delight and bedazzle
the bibliographer.</p>

<p>There is no such bibliography of the works of Arthur
Machen in existence, nor does this one pretend or propose
to fill that need. What is also needed, however, and by
readers rather than collectors, is a complete listing of the
works of Machen, together with notes on their appearance
in print and clues to their possible location. Such a
listing presents certain typographical problems which I have
tried to work out without having to resort to the cabalistic
symbols common to certain catalogues and all time tables.</p>

<p>It is my belief that people who like to read Machen
like also to read about Machen, therefore I have added a
listing of books and articles in which there appears more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
than a mere mention of Arthur Machen. Furthermore, since
I feel that I have not listed all of these, nor all the Works
for that matter, I have provided several blank pages for
the use of the eventual owner of this book. Such additional
information as he may gather may be entered on these pages
under the general heading of “Notes.”</p>

<p>This then is the purpose of the unconventional bibliography
that follows: to lead and direct the general reader
to the work of Arthur Machen, and to direct him to certain
books and sources in which may be found material of
interest to the admirers of Arthur Machen.</p>

<h3><i>THE ESSAYS</i>:</h3>

<p>The Essays of Arthur Machen are listed alphabetically below.
Machen was, for many years, a practicing journalist, writing for many
papers and journals. Obviously not all of his pieces, nor even all of
the best of his pieces, have appeared in book form. Obviously, too, it
is impossible for anyone to obtain copies of the many papers for
which he wrote, or even of the various journals and magazines
listed herein. This listing is therefore far from being complete—it
lists only those pieces which are available, or should be, or have
been, in print. Many of these pieces are undated, except as having
appeared between dates that may be a decade apart. This is, unfortunately,
unavoidable. There is little we can do about it, except to
suggest that someone establish a Fellowship for the sole purpose of
investigating and excavating the complete published works of Arthur
Machen.</p>

<h3><i>TRANSLATIONS</i>:</h3>

<p>The translations made by Arthur Machen must certainly be
listed among his major works, although they are not the most important.
All of them are from the French, all of them were made
early in his career as a writer (and some of them under unusual
circumstances). Of these, the most important is his translation of the
Memoirs of the redoubtable Casanova. The listing that follows is
not complete, I am quite sure that <i>Heptameron</i> and the <i>Memoirs</i>,
at least, have appeared in many editions of which I have not heard
and which may not be credited to Machen.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">Casanova, Memoirs of</span>, translation made by Machen as part of his “duties”
while working for a London bookseller. Privately published in London,
1894. Also published by L. C. Page, Boston, 1903; Knopf, New York,
1929.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casanova’s Escape from the Leads</span>, published in London in 1925 and by
Knopf, New York, 1925.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fantastic Tales</span>, Machen’s translation of Beroalde de Verville’s “Le Moyen
de Parvenir.” Privately printed at “Carbonnek” (James Wade, London),
1890.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fortunate Lovers, The</span>, described by Machen as a “drawing room edition”
of the <i>HEPTAMERON</i>. Published by Redway, London, 1887.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heptameron, The</span>, translation of the memoirs of Marguerite, Queen of
Navarre. Privately printed by the Dryden Press, 1886. Issued by Knopf,
New York, 1924. There are other editions.</p>

<h3><i>MISCELLANEOUS</i>:</h3>

<p>The man of letters, the practicing man of letters that is, finds
himself doing all sorts of things in the practice of his trade. Machen
was a working man of letters for most of his eighty-odd years. He
wrote articles and “leaders” and “turn-overs” and “fills” and many
another journalistic oddity. He composed calendars and catalogues
in his time and, I daresay, book reviews. To attempt to collect or to
list all of this material would be to display the Machen-mania in its
most advanced stages.</p>

<p>This classification seems to me a proper one in which to include,
for example, Machen’s first published work, the elusive <i>Eleusinia</i>,
the classic <i>Hieroglyphics</i>, the autobiographical books and the collections
of his works, certain prefaces and introductions and one or two
of the better known catalogues and “fugitive pieces,” to use a rather
pedantic term. I am being, I suppose, rather arbitrary here too, but
I do not consider that every “fugitive piece” is worthy of the chase.</p>

First published by Secker in London, 1924, Knopf of New York, 1924.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prefaces</span>, written especially for the Knopf editions in the early 1920s. Most
of them are rather autobiographical, all of them are authentic “firsts”.
The Knopf books containing these prefaces are: The Three Impostors,
The House of Souls, The Hill of Dreams, Dr. Stiggins, The Anatomy of
Tobacco and possibly one or two others. The Introduction to <i>THE
SHINING PYRAMID</i>, which refers to the Starrett collection of the
same name, was presumably written for the London Edition, published
in London by Secker, 1925.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prefaces</span>: Machen wrote a number of introductions, prefaces and forewords
for various books, translations, etc. The professional collector and bibliographer
would be inclined, no doubt, to treat these in a different
manner. For our purpose we find it sufficient to list them as follows
under this heading:</p>

<h3>MORE ABOUT MACHEN</h3>

<p>The admirers of Arthur Machen, as we have remarked before,
will want to read as much about him as they possibly can. There are
not too many articles or studies of Machen available. Standard
reference books list Machen, of course, but few of them present
more than a brief sketch. Many standard critical works mention
Machen in connection with his period, the 1890’s, or his genre, the
supernatural tale. Book reviews have, of course, appeared by the
hundreds. These might be interesting to read again, but they are
unavailable. The general reader, meaning in this case, the admirer
of Machen, will wish to check this listing:</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
